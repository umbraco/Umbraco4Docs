# Configuring the Grid Layout data type
A grid layout contains multiple configuration options to allow developers to tailor the grid to a very specific site design.
Configuring the layout can be divided into 2 overall parts:

## Layouts
A layout is the general grid "container", it contains one or more sections which content editors can use to insert preconfigured **rows**. There are 2 main usage scenarios of layouts:

1. A single column layout which to the content editor will act like a full page canvas to insert elements on
2. A multiple column layout with a main content body, and one or more sidebar columns to insert lists or other sidebar widgets on.

You can however configure as many layouts and layout sections as you wish, each section in the layout must be given a width in columns, so editors gets an accurate preview of their layout.

## Row configurations
A row in the grid editor contains one or more cells, which divide the row into areas where editors can enter content. So a row is merely a container of areas to insert content into. When you add a new row, you are asked to give it a name, then define cells inside the row by clicking the "+" icon. Each cell has a default width set to 4, but by clicking the inserted cell you can control its width.

It is possible to setup configurable attributes(class, rel, href) and inline styling on rows.

You can add as many cells as you like. If they overflow the total width of the row, they will be arranged after each other horizontally as you'd expect in a grid system.

Each cell can by default contain any type of editor such as textstring editors, imagespicker, embedded media or Umbraco macros. To override this behavior, uncheck the **allow all editors** option and you can specify which editors will be available for the row.
