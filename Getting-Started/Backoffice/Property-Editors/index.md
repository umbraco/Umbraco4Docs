# Property Editors

A Property Editor is the editor that a Data Type references. A Data Type is defined by a user in the Umbraco backoffice and references a Property Editor. In Umbraco a Property Editor is defined in a JSON manifest file and associated JavaScript files.

When creating a Data Type, you specify the property editor for the Data Type to use by selecting from the "Property editor" list (as shown below).
