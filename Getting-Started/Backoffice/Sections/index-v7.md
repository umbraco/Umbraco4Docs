# Sections
A section in Umbraco is where you do specific tasks related to that section. For example Content, Settings, and Developer are all sections. You can navigate between the different sections by clicking the corresponding icon in the section menu which is on the left-hand side of the backoffice.

*The __Section menu__ is the vertical menu located on the left side of the backoffice.*

There are eight default sections that come with Umbraco:

### <img src="images/Content.png" style="width:60px;vertical-align:middle" /> Content
The content section contains the content of the website. Content is displayed as nodes in the content tree. Nodes can also show content state:

* Grayed out nodes have not been published
* <img src="images/has-unpublished-version.svg" width="12px" style="margin: 0;"> Nodes have unpublished versions (but are currently published)
* <img src="images/protected.svg" width="12px" style="margin: 0;"> Nodes are protected from the public (require logging in)
* <img src="images/locked.svg" width="12px" style="margin: 0;"> Nodes are currently locked/non-deletable
* <img src="images/is-container.svg" width="12px" style="margin: 0;"> Nodes are containers (such as List Views)

In order to create content you must define it using Document Types.

### <img src="images/Media.png" style="width:60px;vertical-align:middle" /> Media
The Media section contains the media for the website. By default you can create folders and upload media files (images and PDFs). You can customize the existing media types or define your own in the Settings section.

### <img src="images/Settings.png" style="width:60px;vertical-align:middle" /> Settings
The Settings section is where you can work with the website layout, language/localization and define media and content. The Settings tree consists of:

- Document Types
- Templates (.cshtml files)
- Partial views (.cshtml files)
- Stylesheets (.css files)
- Scripts (.js files)
- Languages
- Dictionary
- Media Types

### <img src="images/Developer.png" style="width:60px;vertical-align:middle" /> Developer
In the developer section you work with packages, data types, macros, relations, XSLT and Razor files. The developer tree consists of:

- Packages
- Data Types
- Macros
- Relation Types

When the help section is opened you get a link to video tutorials about the section you're in.
