### Richtext Editor
The TinyMCE based wysiwyg editor. This is the standard editor used to edit any larger amount of text. The editor has a lot of settings, which can be changed under the developer section in "data types" / Richtext editor. The editor also supports TinyMCE plugins which can be controlled in the configuration file located at /config/tinyMce.config

In the default settings some tags such as bullet list can be used. If you want to use other tags like h1 or h2, you need to add stylesheets.

Create child stylesheets for each tag(h1 or h2) under a base one.
Go to "Backoffice->Developer->Data Types->Richtext editor" and associate rich text editor with the base.
Also turn on "styleselect" in the toolbar section.
You can find a new button in the toolbar of the content editor.

An example of the style sheet tree is as follows.

<pre>
Stylesheets
-IE7
-IE8
-Style
-RichEdit
--h1
--h2
</pre>

### Textarea

### True/False
A checkbox which saves either 0 or 1, depending on the checkbox being checked or not. A common use for instance is to create a property with the special alias 'umbracoNaviHide' and the Data-Type True/False to enable editors to hide nodes from appearing in a navigation menu.

### Upload
Adds an upload field, which allows documents or images to be uploaded to Umbraco. This does not add them to the media library, they are added to the document data.
