# Running Umbraco on a Mac
*To run a local installation of Umbraco on a Mac you need to setup a vm that runs Microsoft Windows*

### Bootcamp
Bootcamp is native vm software for Mac OS. See how to install Windows with Bootcamp [here](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468).

### Parallels
Parallels is third party and enables integration between Mac OS and Windows ie. running Windows Apps from the dock. Get it [here](https://www.parallels.com). 

When your vm is running windows, follow the instructions for [installing Umbraco](index.md).

### VMWare Fusion
VMWare Fusion is a third party virtualization software which can be used to run Windows on your Mac.  Get it [here](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html).  Just like with Parallels you should follow these [install instructions for Umbraco](index.md) after you have Windows installed.
