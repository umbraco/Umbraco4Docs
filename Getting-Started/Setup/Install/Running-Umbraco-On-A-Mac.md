# Running Umbraco on a Mac
*To run a local installation of Umbraco on a Mac you need to setup a Virtual Machine "vm" that runs Microsoft Windows*

### Bootcamp
Bootcamp is native vm software for Mac OS. See how to install Windows with Bootcamp [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468).

### Parallels
Parallels is a third party vm solution that enables integration between Mac OS and Windows ie. running Windows Apps from the dock. Get it [here](https://www.parallels.com).

When your vm is running Windows, follow the instructions for [installing Umbraco](index.md).

### VMWare Fusion
VMWare Fusion is third party virtualization software that can be used to run Windows on your Mac.  Get it [here](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html). In the same way as Parallels, you should follow these [install instructions for Umbraco](index.md) after you have installed Windows.

### VirtualBox
VirtualBox is another free and open-source virtualization software. Please follow [the detailed instructions](http://osxdaily.com/2015/03/25/install-run-windows-10-mac-virtualbox-os-x/) on their website to get up and running with Windows on your Mac.
