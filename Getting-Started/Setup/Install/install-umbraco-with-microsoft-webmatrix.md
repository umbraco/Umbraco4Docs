1. Go to [http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/](http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/) and download WebMatrix 3 for free.

1. From the results select the item marked **Umbraco CMS**. Click **Next**.

1. In the **Site Name** box give your site an appropriate name and click **Next** again.

	*The list of items may be more than just Umbraco as shown in the screenshot. This is because WebMatrix uses the Web Platform installer behind the scenes to install Umbraco and will also download any other software that is required in order for the website to run.*

1. The next screen presents you with two options for the database to be used by Umbraco. Choose the option marked **SQL CE Server (Installed)** and click **Next**. This is the quickest and easiest option to get started with Umbraco - especially for small sites - and uses a file stored on disk as the database.

	*If you need to migrate your database from SQL CE Server to the full edition of SQL Server, you can do it at a later point.*

1. Accept the licensing terms and conditions by clicking **I Accept**.

1. WebMatrix will download the required files to run Umbraco. Once done you will see a confirmation message.

### Congratulations, you have installed an Umbraco site!

### Note
*You can log into your Umbraco site by entering the following into your browser: http://yoursite.com/umbraco/*

### Post installation
One important recommendation is to always remove the `install` folder immediately after installing Umbraco and never to upload it to a live server.
