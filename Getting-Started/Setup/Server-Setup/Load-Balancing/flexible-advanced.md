# Advanced techniques with Flexible Load Balancing

_This describes some more advanced techniques that you could achieve with flexible load balancing_

## Explicit Master Scheduling server

It is recommended to configure an explicit master scheduling server since this reduces the amount 
complexity that the [master election](flexible.md#scheduling-and-master-election) process performs.

This is configurable and in order to do this you will need to have separate application startup handlers
for your front-end servers and your admin server... you can make this a configuration option in your own code.

The first thing to do is create a a couple classes for your front-end servers and master server to use:

	public class MasterServerRegistrar : IServerRegistrar2
	{
		public IEnumerable<IServerAddress> Registrations
		{
			get { return Enumerable.Empty<IServerAddress>(); }
		}
		public ServerRole GetCurrentServerRole()
		{
			return ServerRole.Master;
		}
		public string GetCurrentServerUmbracoApplicationUrl()
		{
			//NOTE: If you want to explicitly define the URL that your application is running on,
			// this wil be used for the server to communicate with itself, you can return the 
			// custom path here and it needs to be in this format:
			// http://www.mysite.com/umbraco

			return null;
		}
	}

	public class FrontEndReadOnlyServerRegistrar : IServerRegistrar2
	{
		public IEnumerable<IServerAddress> Registrations
		{
			get { return Enumerable.Empty<IServerAddress>(); }
		}        
		public ServerRole GetCurrentServerRole()
		{
			return ServerRole.Slave;
		}        
		public string GetCurrentServerUmbracoApplicationUrl()
		{
			return null;
		}
	}

then you'll need to swap the default `DatabaseServerRegistrar` for the your custom registrars during application startup.
You'll need to create an [ApplicationEventHandler](/Documentation/Reference/Events/Application-Startup) and override `ApplicationStarting`. 
During this event you can swap the registrar objects:

	//This should be executed on your master server
	ServerRegistrarResolver.Current.SetServerRegistrar(new MasterServerRegistrar());

	//This should be executed on your slave servers
	ServerRegistrarResolver.Current.SetServerRegistrar(new FrontEndReadOnlyServerRegistrar());

Now that your front-end servers are using your custom `FrontEndReadOnlyServerRegistrar` class, they will always be deemed 'Slave' servers and will not 
attempt any master election or task scheduling.

By setting your master server to use your custom `MasterServerRegistrar` class, it will always be deemed the 'Master' and will always be the one that 
executes all task scheduling.

## Front-end servers - Readonly database access

_This description pertains ONLY to Umbraco database tables_

In some cases infrastructure admins will not want their front-end servers to have write access to the database. 
By default front-end servers will require write full access to the following tables:

* umbracoServer
* umbracoNode

This is because by default each server will inform the database that they are active and more importantly it is
used for task scheduling. Only a single server can execute task scheduling and these tables are used for servers 
to use a master server election process without the need for any configuration. So in the case that a front-end
server becomes the master task scheduler, **it will actually require write access to all of the Umbraco tables**.

In order to have readonly database access configured for your front-end servers, you need to implement 
the [Explicit master scheduling server](#explicit-master-scheduling-server) configuration mentioned above.

Now that your front-end servers are using your custom `FrontEndReadOnlyServerRegistrar` class, they will always be deemed 'Slave' servers and will not 
attempt any master election or task scheduling and because you are no longer using the default `DatabaseServerRegistrar` they will not try to ping
the umbracoServer table.
