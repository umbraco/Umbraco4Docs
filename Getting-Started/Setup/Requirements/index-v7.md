# System Requirements

## Browsers
The Umbraco UI should work in all modern browsers:

* Safari (Latest)
* IE10+ (will not always work correctly in lower versions)
* Edge

## Local Development
* Microsoft Windows 7 SP1
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [IISExpress extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=warren-buckley.iis-express) or [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) 2017 (2015 with a C# compiler plug-in may work but not painlessly)
* ASP.NET 4.5+ Full-Trust

## Hosting
* IIS 7+
* SQL CE, SQL Server 2008 and higher or MySQL (in case insensitive mode)
* ASP.NET 4.5 Full-Trust
* Ability to set file permissions to include create/read/write (or better) for the user that "owns" the Application Pool for your site (NETWORK SERVICE, typically)

## Note
* Umbraco will not run on ASP.NET Core
