# Working with stylesheets and JavaScript

## Bundling & Minification for JavaScript and CSS

You can of course use whatever tools you are comfortable with for bundling & minification but it's worth
noting that Umbraco ships with the ClientDependency Framework which offers runtime bundling & minification.

You can bundle and minify as follows in a view template file.

```csharp
@using ClientDependency.Core.Mvc
@using ClientDependency.Core
@{
    Html.RequiresJs("~/scripts/Script1.js", 1);
    Html.RequiresJs("~/scripts/Script2.js", 2);

    Html.RequiresCss("~/css/style.css");
}
<html>
<head>
    @Html.RenderCssHere()
    @Html.RenderJsHere()
</head>
```
