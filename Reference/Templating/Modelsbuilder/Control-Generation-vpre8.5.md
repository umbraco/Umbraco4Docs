# Control Models Generation

Generation of models can be controlled through various C# attributes in the custom files (i.e. `*.cs` files that are not `*.generated.cs` files) in the models directory.

:::note
This section is probably slightly confusing - because some attribute behaviors are not precisely specified. Not always sure what happens with compositions etc. There is a current work-in-progress to refactor the attributes so that they make more sense.
:::

## Ignore Content Type

Indicates that a content type with a given alias should be ignored and not generated. The attribute is an assembly attribute.

```csharp
[assembly:IgnoreContentType("widgetsContainer")]
```

This will cause the content type class `widgetsContainer` to _not_ be generated.

**Note**: Must document what happens when it is a parent content type, or when it is part of a composition.

## Ignore Property Type

Indicates that a property type with a given alias should be ignored and not generated. The attribute must decorate the corresponding content type class.

```csharp
[IgnorePropertyType("umbracoUrlName")]
public partial class NewsItem
{ }
```

This will cause the property `umbracoUrlName` to _not_ be generated in the `NewsItem` class.

## Implement Content Type

Indicates that a class implements a content type with a given alias. The attribute must decorate the corresponding content type class. Use when alias and class name do not match.

```csharp
[ImplementContentType("eventCalendar")]
public partial class Calendar : PublishedContentModel
{ }
```

This will cause the content type class `eventCalendar` to _not_ be generated, since you already implement it.

**Note**: Not sure of this. Maybe it's only renaming the generated class.

## Implement Property Type

Indicates that a property implements a property type with a given alias. The attribute must decorate the corresponding property type property. Use when alias and property name do not match.

```csharp
public partial class Employee
{
  [ImplementPropertyType("employeeAge")]
  public int Age { get { return this.Value<int>("employeeAge"); } }
}
```

This will cause the property `employeeAge` to _not_ be generated, since you already implement it as `Age`.

## Rename Content Type

Indicates a different class name for a content type. The attribute is an assembly attribute. Use when alias and class name do not match.

```csharp
[assembly:RenameContentType("eventCalendar", "Calendar")]
```

This will cause the content type class to be generated, with the class name `Calendar` instead of `EventCalendar`.

## Rename Property Type

Indicates a different property name for a property type. The attribute must decorate the corresponding content type class. Use when alias and property name do not match.

```csharp
[RenamePropertyType("employeeAge", "Age")]
public partial class Employee
{ }
```

This will cause the property to be generated, with the name `Age` instead of `EmployeeAge`.

## Models Base Class

Indicates the base class for all models. By default the base class is `PublishedContentModel` but the attribute lets you override it. The attribute is an assembly attribute. The base class should inherit from `PublishedContentModel`.

```csharp
[assembly:ModelsBaseClass(typeof (WebsiteContentModel))]
```

## Models Namespace

Indicates the namespace for all models. Overrides every other namespace that might have been configured. The attribute is an assembly attribute.

```csharp
[assembly:ModelsNamespace("CompanyWebsite.ContentModels")]
```

## Models Using

Indicates extra `using` statements to be inserted in model files. The models generator already inserts some common `using` statements, plus tries to be clever, but it is not always enough. The attribute is an assembly attribute.

```csharp
[assembly:ModelsUsing("CompanyWebsite.Configuration")]
```
