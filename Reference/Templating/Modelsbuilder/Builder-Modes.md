# Builder Modes

Models Builder can be used in different modes:

* PureLive models
* Dll models
* AppData models
* API models

The mode is indicated by the `Umbraco.ModelsBuilder.ModelsMode` key in the `appSettings` section of the `Web.config` file.

## Pure Live Models

Corresponds to the `PureLive` setting value.

With **PureLive** models, models are generated and compiled on the fly, in memory, at runtime. They are available in views exclusively. This is for people who exclusively use the Umbraco backoffice, and probably do not write custom code such as controllers anyway. Whenever a content type is modified, models are updated without restarting Umbraco (in the same way .cshtml views are recompiled).

If the `~/App_Data/Models` directory contains any non-generated C# files (i.e. `*.cs` but not `*.generated.cs`), Models Builder parses these files for instructions, and includes them in the compilation (see [documentation for configuring and extending models](Control-Generation.md)).

Generation _can_ fail for various reasons, in which case Umbraco will run without models (and front-end views probably fail to render). Umbraco's log file should contain all details about what prevented the generation, but it is probably faster to check the Models Builder dashboard, which should report the last error that was encountered, if any.

Models Builder maintains some files in `~/App_Data/Models`:

* `models.generated.cs` contains the generated models code
* `all.generated.cs` contains the compiled code (models merged with non-generated files)
* `models.hash` contains a hash code of the content types
* `models.err` contains the last generation error information, if any

The `models.hash` file is used when Umbraco restarts, to figure out whether models have changed and need to be re-generated. Otherwise, the local `models.generated.cs` file is reused.

## Dll Models

Corresponds to the `Dll` and `LiveDll` setting values.

With **Dll** models, models are generated in the `~/App_Data/Models` directory, then compiled into a Dll that is copied into `~/bin`, thus restarting the application. Models must be generated explicitly from the dashboard or the content type editor.

If the `~/App_Data/Models` directory contains any non-generated C# files (i.e. `*.cs` but not `*.generated.cs`), Models Builder parses these files for instructions, and includes them in the compilation (see [documentation for configuring and extending models](Control-Generation.md)).

Because models are in a Dll, they become visible to custom code, controllers, etc. and can even be referenced in Visual Studio to benefit from Intellisense.

Generation _can_ fail for various reasons, in which case Umbraco will run without models (and front-end views probably fail to render). Umbraco's log file should contain all details about what prevented the generation, but it is probably faster to check the Models Builder dashboard, which should report the last error that was encountered, if any.

**LiveDll** models work much in the same way, except that generation takes place automatically whenever content types change. This means that Umbraco will restart anytime a content type is modified, which is not very efficient. You probably do _not_ want to use LiveDll models.

## AppData Models

Corresponds to the `AppData` and `LiveAppData` setting values.

With **AppData** models, models are generated in the `~/App_Data/Models` directory, and that is all. It is then up to you to decide how to compile the models (e.g. by including them in a Visual Studio solution).

If the `~/App_Data/Models` directory contains any non-generated C# files (i.e. `*.cs` but not `*.generated.cs`), Models Builder parses these files for instructions (see [documentation for configuring and extending models](Control-Generation.md)).

Generation _can_ fail for various reasons, in which case no models are generated. Umbraco's log file should contain all details about what prevented the generation, but it is probably faster to check the Models Builder dashboard, which should report the last error that was encountered, if any.

**LiveAppData** models work much in the same way, except that generation takes place automatically whenever content types change. Because generation does not cause any compilation, it does not cause Umbraco to restart, either.

## API models

With **API** models, Models Builder does _not_ generate models into the Umbraco website, but exposes an API that allows external tools to retrieve models. The Models Builder source code contains a sample console tool that connects to the website and retrieves models. In addition, a Visual Studio extension is available, which enables models generation straight from Visual Studio.

In both cases **an additional NuGet package must be installed** into the site [Umbraco.ModelsBuilder.Api](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.ModelsBuilder.Api/), and the API must be enabled, see [Install And Configure](Install-And-Configure.md).

Although it is possible to enable the API while still generating models into the Umbraco website, this probably does not make much sense. Therefore, you will want to set the `Umbraco.ModelsBuilder.ModelsMode` to `Nothing` (or remove it entirely). Do _not_ disable Models Builder entirely, though, as that would also disable the models factory (i.e., models would be ignored).

When the API is enabled and the Visual Studio extension is installed:

* Go to Visual Studio **Tools** | **Options** | **Umbraco** | **ModelsBuilder Options** and configure the URL to your website (e.g. http://www.example.com), and a login and password for an Umbraco user that has permission to access the _Developer_ section.
* Create a folder in your solution -- pick your own name. Within that folder, create a C# file -- again, pick your own name. The file can contain code, or just be empty.
* Edit the properties of the file and set the **Custom tool** value to **UmbracoModelsBuilder**.
* Save the file, or right-click and _Run Custom Tool_. New files should appear underneath the file.

These new files are the generated models. They are automatically added to the Visual Studio project and will be compiled alongside the rest of your project. Anytime you need to refresh the models, simply run the custom tool.

If there are some non-generated C# files (i.e. `*.cs` but not `*.generated.cs`) in the folder, Models Builder will parse them for instructions (see [documentation for configuring and extending models](Control-Generation.md)) and Visual Studio will compile them too.

In order for Visual Studio to compile the project successfully, it needs to reference the Models Builder Dll, so you probably want to install the [ModelsBuilder NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.ModelsBuilder/) in the project.

**Note**: The settings/options (URL, username and password) are saved _for each solution_ in a file named after the solution, i.e. for solution `<solution>.sln` the file would be `<solution>.UmbracoModelsBuilder.user` in the same directory. It is therefore possible to switch between solutions without re-entering the settings. Because the file contains a password and is relevant to one developer only, it _should not_ be source-controlled.
