# Partial View Macros

_Partial view macros are the recommended macro type to use in Umbraco. They work in both MVC and Webforms and use the unified query syntax that is available via the `UmbracoHelper`_

## View/Model Type

All partial view macro views inherit from `Umbraco.Web.Macros.PartialViewMacroPage` and as such, the header of each partial view macro file will have this syntax:

```csharp
@inherits Umbraco.Web.Macros.PartialViewMacroPage
```

The model type for a partial view macro is `Umbraco.Web.Models.PartialViewMacroModel` which contains all of the properties you will need to
render out content as well as some additional properties about the macro itself: `MacroName`, `MacroAlias`, `MacroId`, and `MacroParameters`.

## File information

By default Partial View Macros are stored in this folder:

> ~/Views/MacroPartials

However if you are bundling up Partial View Macros as part of a package, they can also exist in this folder:

> ~/App_Plugins/[YourPackageName]/Views/MacroPartials

Since Partial View Macros are a normal MVC partial view, their file extension is **cshtml**. All Partial View Macro views inherit from the view class

```csharp
Umbraco.Web.Macros.PartialViewMacroPage
```

Therefore all files will contain this header (which is done automatically for you if creating Partial View Macros via the Umbraco backoffice):

```csharp
@inherits Umbraco.Web.Macros.PartialViewMacroPage
```

## Accessing content

The syntax in Partial View Macros is 100% on par with the **[MVC View](../../Mvc/views.md)** syntax, in fact they are driven by the exact same engine as MVC Views.

You can use @CurrentPage, @Model.Content, @Umbraco, ...

## Accessing macro parameters

You can access the macro's parameters using the `MacroParameters` property on the model which is of type `IDictionary<string, object>`

```csharp
var myParam = Model.MacroParameters["aliasOfTheMacroParameter"];
```

or via the typed GetParameterValue method in Umbraco.Web.Models namespace

```csharp
var myParam = Model.GetParameterValue<string>("aliasOfTheMacroParameter");
```

and with default value fallback

```csharp
var myParam = Model.GetParameterValue<string>("aliasOfTheMacroParameter", "default value if parameter value has not been set");
```
