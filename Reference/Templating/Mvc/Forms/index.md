# Creating Html Forms

_Creating an HTML form to submit data with MVC in Umbraco is possible in a few steps. You'll need to create a SurfaceController, a 'View Model' class and use a handy HtmlHelper extension method called BeginUmbracoForm._

* [Creating an MVC form with custom html markup](tutorial-custom-markup.md)

## Creating a form - The View Model

First off we need to define the data that will be submitted, this is done by creating a 'View Model' class. Here's an example:

    public class CommentViewModel
    {
        [Required]
        public string Name { get; set; }

        [Required]
        public string Email { get; set; }

        [Required]
        [Display(Name = "Enter a comment")]
        public string Comment { get; set; }
    }

This class defines the data that will be submitted and also defines how the data will be validated upon submission. MVC automatically wires up these validation attributes with the front-end so JavaScript validation will automagically occur.

## Creating the SurfaceController Action

Next up, we need to create an Action on a SurfaceController which accepts our submitted View Model. Here's an example (this is a locally declared controller):

    public class BlogPostSurfaceController : Umbraco.Web.Mvc.SurfaceController
    {
        [HttpPost]
        public ActionResult CreateComment(CommentViewModel model)
        {
            // model not valid, do not save, but return current Umbraco page
            if (!ModelState.IsValid)
            {
                // Perhaps you might want to add a custom message to the ViewBag
                // which will be available on the View when it renders (since we're not
                // redirecting)
                    return CurrentUmbracoPage();
            }

            // if validation passes perform whatever logic
            // In this sample we keep it empty, but try setting a breakpoint to see what is posted here

            // Perhaps you might want to store some data in TempData which will be available
            // in the View after the redirect below. An example might be to show a custom 'submit
            // successful' message on the View, for example:
            TempData.Add("CustomMessage", "Your form was successfully submitted at " + DateTime.Now);

            // redirect to current page to clear the form
            return RedirectToCurrentUmbracoPage();

            // Or redirect to specific page
            // return RedirectToUmbracoPage(12345)
        }
    }

## Using BeginUmbracoForm

Lastly we need to render the HTML form to ensure that it posts to the surface controller created. The easiest way to do this is to create a separate PartialView to render your form with the model type declared as your ViewModel. There's a few overloads for the BeginUmbracoForm method, we'll start with the simplest one:

    @model CommentViewModel

    @using(Html.BeginUmbracoForm("CreateComment", "BlogPostSurface"))
    {
        @Html.EditorFor(x => Model)
        <input type="submit"/>
    }

The above code snippet is a PartialView to render the form. Because the Model for the view is the ViewModel we want to scaffold the form, we can do an `@Html.EditorFor(x => Model)` to automatically create all of the input fields.

#### BeginUmbracoForm Overloads

This lists the different overloads available for BeginUmbracoForm:

    // as seen in the above example
    BeginUmbracoForm(this HtmlHelper html, string action, string controllerName)

    // The next three are the same as above but allow you to specify additional route values and/or html attributes for the form tag
    BeginUmbracoForm(this HtmlHelper html, string action, string controllerName, object additionalRouteVals)
    BeginUmbracoForm(this HtmlHelper html, string action, string controllerName, object additionalRouteVals, object htmlAttributes)
    BeginUmbracoForm(this HtmlHelper html, string action, string controllerName, object additionalRouteVals, IDictionary<string, object> htmlAttributes)

    // Allows you to specify the action name and controller type either by a generic type or type object:
    BeginUmbracoForm(this HtmlHelper html, string action, Type surfaceType)
    BeginUmbracoForm<T>(this HtmlHelper html, string action)
    BeginUmbracoForm(this HtmlHelper html, string action, Type surfaceType, object additionalRouteVals)
    BeginUmbracoForm<T>(this HtmlHelper html, string action, object additionalRouteVals)
    BeginUmbracoForm(this HtmlHelper html, string action, Type surfaceType, object additionalRouteVals, object htmlAttributes)
    BeginUmbracoForm<T>(this HtmlHelper html, string action, object additionalRouteVals, object htmlAttributes)
    BeginUmbracoForm(this HtmlHelper html, string action, Type surfaceType, object additionalRouteVals, IDictionary<string, object> htmlAttributes)
    BeginUmbracoForm<T>(this HtmlHelper html, string action, object additionalRouteVals, IDictionary<string, object> htmlAttributes)

    // The following are only used for plugin based surface controllers. If you don't want to specify
    // the controller type, you can specify the area that the plugin SurfaceController is routed to
    BeginUmbracoForm(this HtmlHelper html, string action, string controllerName, string area)
    BeginUmbracoForm(this HtmlHelper html, string action, string controllerName, string area, object additionalRouteVals, IDictionary<string, object> htmlAttributes)

## Understanding the Routing Process

There's been numerous cases of people attempting to return a PartialView directly from their [HttpPost] action due to not fully understanding the routing process of POSTing data to the server. This will explain the sequence of events. For this example we'll assume that the page that is rendering is at the address: http://mysite.com/feedback

### 1. Umbraco page requested

1. A user visits the page http://mysite.com/feedback
2. Umbraco finds this content page

### 2. Umbraco page rendered
1. The RenderMvcController executes the request for the current page
2. An MVC view is rendered which contains a partial view with an html form created with `BeginUmbracoForm`

### 3. User submits the form

1. The user fills out the form and submits it
2. An http POST is made (you'll notice to the same URL that is currently rendering: http://mysite.com/feedback)
3. Umbraco finds the content page
4. Umbraco detects that a POST has been made
5. Umbraco decrypts a special hidden value injected into the POST by the BeginUmbracoForm
6. Using this decrypted data it routes the request directly to the SurfaceController's [HttpPost] action
7. The [HttpPost] action executes returning "CurrentUmbracoPage()" if the data is invalid or "RedirectToCurrentUmbracoPage()" if the data is valid...

    #### 3.1 RedirectToCurrentUmbracoPage()

    1. The request is completely redirected, the process starts back over again at **1. Umbraco page requested**

    #### 3.2 CurrentUmbracoPage()

    1. Since the request is not valid any model errors will be automatically added to the ModelState dictionary. You can also manually add any errors to the ModelState dictionary.
    2. The call to `return CurrentUmbracoPage()` sends the request back through the Umbraco pipeline and maintains the current ModelState and ViewData
    3. The process starts again at **2. Umbraco page rendered**

You can see that if you returned a Partial View from within your [HttpPost] action, the only thing that would happen is that you'd end up displaying only the markup for the partial view to the end-user. This is because you are not sending the request back to Umbraco.

## Display success messages

Displaying a success message is easy. You can either send the user to a totally different page. For example you could use `return RedirectToUmbracoPage(nodeId)`. This page would typically be a child of the page where the form is located in, which is hidden in the navigation.

The other way is to add a message or something to the TempData. For example you could use `TempData.Add("Success", "your form was successfully submitted");` in your SurfaceController action, and then display the message using `@TempData["Success"]` in the page where the form is located in.
