# Custom controllers (Hijacking Umbraco Routes)

_If you need complete control over how your pages are rendered then Hijacking Umbraco Routes is for you_

## What is Hijacking Umbraco Routes?

By default all of the front end routing is executed via the `Umbraco.Web.Mvc.RenderMvcController` Index Action which should work fine for most people. However, in some cases people may want complete control over this execution and may  want their own Action to execute. Some reasons for this may be: to control exactly how views are rendered, custom/granular security for certain pages/templates or to be able to execute any custom code in the controller that renders the front end. The good news is that this is completely possible.

## Creating a custom controller

 Let's demonstrate with an example : let's say you have a Document Type called 'Home'.  You can create a custom locally declared controller in your MVC web project called 'HomeController' and ensure that it inherits from `Umbraco.Web.Mvc.RenderMvcController`. Now all pages that are of document type 'Home' will be routed through your custom controller!

In order for you to run some code in your controller you'll need to override the Index Action. Here’s an example:

```csharp
public class HomeController : Umbraco.Web.Mvc.RenderMvcController
{
    public override ActionResult Index(ContentModel model)
    {
        // Do some stuff here, then return the base method
        return base.Index(model);
    }
}
```
    
Now you can run any code that you want inside of that Action!

## Routing via template

To further extend this, we've also allowed routing to different Actions based on the Template that is being rendered. By default only the Index Action exists which will execute for all requests of the corresponding document type. However, if the template being rendered is called 'HomePage' and you have an Action on your controller called 'HomePage' then it will execute instead of the Index Action. As an example, say we have a Home Document Type which has 2 allowed Templates: ‘HomePage’ and ‘MobileHomePage’ and we only want to do some custom stuff for when the ‘MobileHomePage’ Template is executed:

```csharp
public class HomeController : Umbraco.Web.Mvc.RenderMvcController
{
    public ActionResult MobileHomePage(ContentModel model)
    {
        // Do some stuff here, the return the base Index method
        return base.Index(model);
    }
}
```

## How the mapping works

* Document Type name = controller name
* Template name = action name (if no action matches or is not specified - then the 'Index' action will be executed).

## Returning a view with a custom model

If you want to return a custom model to a view then there are a few steps that need to be taken.

### Changing the @inherits directive of your template

First, the standard view that is created by Umbraco inherits from `Umbraco.Web.Mvc.UmbracoViewPage` which has a model defined of type `Umbraco.Web.Models.ContentModel`. You'll see the inherits directive at the top of the view as:

```csharp
@inherits Umbraco.Web.Mvc.UmbracoViewPage
```
or if you are using modelsbuilder:

```csharp
@inherits Umbraco.Web.Mvc.UmbracoViewPage<HomePage>
```
(A model is generated for each document type to give strongly typed access to properties in the template)

If you are returning a custom model, then this directive will need to change because your custom model will not be an instance of `Umbraco.Web.Models.ContentModel`. Instead change your @inherits directive to inherit from `Umbraco.Web.Mvc.UmbracoViewPage<T>` where 'T' is the type of your custom model. So for example, if your custom model is of type 'MyCustomModel' then your @inherits directive will look like:

```csharp
@inherits Umbraco.Web.Mvc.UmbracoViewPage<MyCustomModel>
```

Please note that if your template uses a layout that expects the model to be of type `Umbraco.Web.Models.ContentModel` then changing the template to inherit from `Umbraco.Web.Mvc.UmbracoViewPage<MyCustomModel>` will cause an exception. This is due to the way ASP.NET MVC works with strongly typed views: the requirement for a specific type applies all the way from the top-most layout down to the template. There are two ways to solve this problem:

1. Break the dependency on `Umbraco.Web.Models.ContentModel` in your layout by having it inherit from `Umbraco.Web.Mvc.UmbracoViewPage<ISomeInterface>` (where IsomeInterface is implemented by all your models and contains the properties the master layout view uses).
2. Make your custom model inherit from `Umbraco.Web.Models.ContentModel` and ensure you pass through the Umbraco model thus:-

```csharp
public class MyNewViewModel : ContentModel
{
    // Standard Model Pass Through
    public MyNewViewModel(IPublishedContent content) : base(content) { }

    // Custom properties here...
    public string MyProperty1 { get; set; }
    public string MyProperty2 { get; set; }
}
```

(this means `@Model...` will continue to work in the layouts used by your template).

### Returning the correct view from your controller

In an example above we reference that you can use the following syntax once you've hijacked a route:

```csharp
// Do some stuff here, the return the base Index method
return base.Index(model);
```

This will work but the object (model) that you pass to the `Index` method must be an instance of `Umbraco.Web.Models.ContentModel` which might not be the case if you have a custom model.
So to return a custom model to the current Umbraco template, we need to use different syntax. Here's an example:

```csharp
public class HomeController : Umbraco.Web.Mvc.RenderMvcController
{
    public ActionResult MobileHomePage(ContentModel model)
    {
        // we will create a custom model
        var myCustomModel = new MyCustomModel(model.Content);

        // TODO: assign some values to the custom model...

        return CurrentTemplate(myCustomModel);
    }
}
```

## Passing values to the controller using query string

You can also pass values directly to the controller action using a query string. All you have to do is to put those fields in action definition and attach values with correct fields names to your URL:

	?myfield1=hello&myfield2=umbraco

This way, fields defined in the action's parameters will get automatically populated:

```csharp
public class HomeController : Umbraco.Web.Mvc.RenderMvcController
{
    public ActionResult MobileHomePage(ContentModel model, string myField1, string myField2)
    {
        //myField1 == "hello"
        //myField2 == "umbraco"

        return CurrentTemplate(myCustomModel);
    }
}
```
## Controller Injection
Injecting services into your controller constructions is possible with Umbraco's underlying dependency injection implementation.
Core services such as the built in ILogger service can just be injected into the constructor for the controller along with your own services:

For example:
```csharp
    public class HomeController : RenderMvcController
    {
    private readonly IMySuperSiteService _siteService;
    private readonly ILogger _logger;
    public MyController(IMySuperSiteService siteService, ILogger logger)
    {
        _siteService = siteService;
    }

    public override ActionResult Index(
    ContentModel model)
    {
    var siteSearchPage = _siteService.GetSearchPage(model.Path);
    ... 
    }
```
    
To wire up a concrete instance of IMySuperSiteService, use a composer:
    
```csharp
    using Umbraco.Core;
    using Umbraco.Core.Logging;
    using Umbraco.Core.Composing;
    namespace MyWebsite.Composers
    {
        public class RegisterSuperSiteServiceComposer : IUserComposer
        {
            public void Compose(Composition composition)
            {
            // Register your service with different Lifetime options: Singleton, Request, Transient, Scope
            composition.Register<IMySuperSiteService, MySuperSiteService>(Lifetime.Singleton);
            }
        }
    }
```
## Change the default controller

In some cases you might want to have your own custom controller execute for all MVC requests when you haven't hijacked a route. This is possible by assigning your own default controller during application startup using a composer.

```csharp
public class SetDefaultRenderMvcControllerComposer : IUserComposer
{
    public void Compose(Composition composition)
    {
        composition.SetDefaultRenderMvcController(typeof(MyRenderMvcController));
    }
}

public class MyRenderMvcController : IRenderMvcController
{
    public void Execute(RequestContext requestContext)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }

    public ActionResult Index(ContentModel model)
    {
        throw new NotImplementedException();
    }
}
```
