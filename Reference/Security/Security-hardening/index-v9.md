# Umbraco Security Hardening

Here you can find some tips and tricks for hardening the security of your Umbraco installation.

## Lock down access to your Umbraco folders (IIS)

By default, there are some folders in your Umbraco installation that should only be used by authenticated users. It’s considered a good practice to lock down these folders to specific IP addresses and/or IP ranges to make sure not everyone can access these.
The folders we want to lock down are `App_Plugins`, `Config`, and `Umbraco`.
The prerequisite for this to work is that you’re using [IISRewrite](../../Routing/IISRewriteRules/index.md).

If you’ve made sure that you’ve installed this on your server we can start locking down our Umbraco folders. This can be done by following these three steps:

1. We are going to lock down `/Umbraco/`, but because API-controllers and Surface-controller will use the path `/umbraco/api/` and `/umbraco/surface/` these will also be locked down. Our first rule in the `IISRewrite.config` file will be used to make sure that these are not locked by IP address.

```xml
<rule name="Ignore" stopProcessing="true">
    <match url="^(?:umbraco/api|umbraco/surface)/" />
    <action type="None" />
</rule>
```

Some older versions of Umbraco also relied on `/umbraco/webservices/`  for load-balancing purposes. If you're load-balancing you should also add `umbraco/webservices`  to the rule.

```xml
<rule name="Ignore" stopProcessing="true">
    <match url="^(?:umbraco/api|umbraco/surface|umbraco/webservices)/" />
    <action type="None" />
</rule>
```

2. Get the IP addresses of your client and write these down like a regular expression. If the IP addresses are for example `213.3.10.8` and `88.4.43.108`, the regular expression would be: "`213.3.10.8|88.4.43.108`".

3. Lock down the folders `App_Plugins`, `Config`, and `Umbraco` (or the renamed version of this folder) by putting this rule into your IISRewrite-rules

```xml
<rule name="Allowed IPs" stopProcessing="true">
    <match url="^(?:app_plugins|config|umbraco)(?:/|$)" />
    <conditions>
        <add input="{REMOTE_ADDR}" negate="true" pattern="213.3.10.8|88.4.43.108" />
    </conditions>
    <action type="AbortRequest" />
</rule>
```

If your server is behind a load balancer, you should use `{HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR}` instead of `{REMOTE_ADDR}` as the input for the rule.

If you now go to `/umbraco/` for example from a different IP address the login screen will not be rendered.

## Rename your Umbraco-folder

:::Note
Renaming your Umbraco folder is currently not supported on Umbraco Cloud.

Not all packages will keep working if you rename your Umbraco folder. Please be aware of this risk and test it in your local environment first.
:::

By default, the login page of Umbraco is available at the path `/umbraco/`. This page is the entrance to your installation and it’s considered good practice to rename your path to a more secure path.
This can be done by following these steps:

1. Clean solution - This will delete the `wwwroot/umbraco` folder
2. Add the following line into a property group element of your `csproj`-file
   - `<UmbracoWwwrootName>my-secret-loginpanel</UmbracoWwwrootName>`
3. Build sulution - This will copy Umbraco content into `wwwroot/my-secret-loginpanel`
4. Change the three keys in your configuration `Umbraco:CMS:Global:ReservedPaths`,`Umbraco:CMS:Global:UmbracoPath`, and `Umbraco:CMS:Global:IconsPath` to your new path:

```json
{
    "Umbraco": {
        "CMS": {
            "Global": {
                "ReservedPaths": "~/app_plugins/,~/install/,~/mini-profiler-resources/,~/my-secret-loginpanel/,",
                "UmbracoPath": "~/my-secret-loginpanel",
                "IconsPath": "~/my-secret-loginpanel/assets/icons"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

From now on, you can only get access to the login screen by going to this path and no longer by going to `/umbraco/`.
