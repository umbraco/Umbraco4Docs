# Web routing

This section allows you to configure the routing for your solution, all of these settings has either default values, or does not need to be configured. However you might want to tweak these settings in some scenarious, for instance if you're running in a load balanced setup.

An example of a web routing config with default values, and a placeholder for application url can be seen here:

```json
"Umbraco": {
  "CMS": {
    "WebRouting": {
      "TryMatchingEndpointsForAllPages": false,
      "TrySkipIisCustomErrors": false,
      "InternalRedirectPreservesTemplate": false,
      "DisableAlternativeTemplates": false,
      "ValidateAlternativeTemplates": false,
      "DisableFindContentByIdPath": false,
      "DisableRedirectUrlTracking": false,
      "UrlProviderMode": "Auto",
      "UmbracoApplicationUrl": "http://www.mysite.com/"
    }
  }
}
```

## Try matching endpoints for all pages

When set to `true` Umbraco will check if any routed endpoints match a front-end request. This happens before the Umbraco dynamic router tries to map the request to a Umbraco content item. This setting should not be necessary as long as the Umbraco catch-all route is registered last.

## Try skip IIS custom errors

Defines the value of Response.TrySkipIisCustomErrors when an error (404, 400, 500...) is encountered. You probably want it to be true in order to prevent IIS from displaying its own 404 or 500 pages, and instead have your own page displayed.

## Internal redirect preserves template

When true, an internal redirect does not reset the alternative template, if any.

## Disable alternative templates

When true, the entire alternative templates feature of Umbraco is disabled.

**validateAlternativeTemplates**
will not load the template from the database. If `false` the template might not exists in the database. Otherwise the template need to exist in the database.

## Validate alternative templates

If set to true alternative templates will be validated

## Disable find content by ID path

When true, content can't be found by their ID meaning that urls such as /1234 do _not_ find content with ID 1234.

## Disable redirect url tracking

When you move and rename pages in Umbraco, 301 permanent redirects are automatically created, set this to true if you do not want this behavior.

## URL provider mode

Will set the URL provider mode, options are:

-   `Default`: Indicates that the URL provider should do what it has been configured to do.
-   `Relative`: Indicates that the URL provider should produce relative URLs exclusively.
-   `Absolute`: Indicates that the URL provider should produce absolute URLs exclusively.
-   `Auto`: Indicates that the URL provider should determine automatically whether to return relative or absolute URLs.

## Umbraco application URL

Defines the Umbraco application URL that the server should reach itself. By default, Umbraco will guess that URL from the first request made to the server. Use this setting if the guess is not correct (because you are behind a load-balancer, for example). Format is: `http://www.mysite.com/`, ensure to contain the scheme (http/https) and complete hostname.
