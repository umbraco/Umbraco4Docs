# Removed settings in version 7

## `<useAspNetMasterPages>`

This is a legacy setting and should not normally be changed.
Enabled by default, you can turn off masterpages and go back and use **the old templating engine (from v3 of Umbraco)**. But it is in no way recommended to do so.

# Changed Settings in 7.0

## `<PropertyContextHelpOption>`

The "icon" is not supported anymore since version 7.0
