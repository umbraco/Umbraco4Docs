# Creating custom sections in the backoffice

The Umbraco backoffice consists of Sections, also referred to as Applications.

While in previous versions this was done with a file applications.config, this file does not exists anymore. 

You can create a custom section by registering it using a `package.manifest` in an *App_Plugins* folder.[Create a Custom Section](../../../Extending/Section-Trees/sections#create-a-custom-section)
