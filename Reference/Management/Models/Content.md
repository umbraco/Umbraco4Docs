# Content

The `Content` class represents a single item in the content tree, its values are fetched directly from the database, not from the cache. **Notice** the Content class should strictly be used for CRUD operations, not complex queries, as it is not flexible nor fast enough for this.

All content is versioned, so on each individual change, a new version is stored. Past versions can only be retrieved from the `Content` api, not from the cache.

 * **Namespace:** `Umbraco.Core.Models`
 * **Assembly:** `Umbraco.Core.dll`

All samples in this document will require references to the following dll:

* Umbraco.Core.dll

All samples in this document will require the following using statements:

content.SetValue("date", DateTime.Now);
contentService.Save(content);
```

### .ToXml()

Returns an `XElement` containing the Content data, based off the latest changes. Is used when the published content is sent to the in-memory xml cache.
