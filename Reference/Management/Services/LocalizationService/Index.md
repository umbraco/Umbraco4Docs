## Getting the service

If you wish to use use the localization service in a class that inherits from one of the Umbraco base classes (eg. `SurfaceController`, `UmbracoApiController` or `UmbracoAuthorizedApiController`), you can access the localization service through a local `Services` property:

	ILocalizationService localizationService = Services.LocalizationService;
	
In Razor views, you can access the localization service through the `ApplicationContext` property:

    ILocalizationService localizationService = ApplicationContext.Services.LocalizationService;

If neither a `Services` property or a `ApplicationContext` property is available, you can also reference the `ApplicationContext` class directly and using the static `Current` property:

	ApplicationContext.Current.Services.LocalizationService
