# ConsentService

**Applies to Umbraco 7.9 and newer**

[Browse the API documentation for ConsentService](https://our.umbraco.com/apidocs/v7/csharp/api/Umbraco.Core.Services.IConsentService.html).

 * **Namespace:** `Umbraco.Core.Services`
 * **Assembly:** `Umbraco.Core.dll`

A service for handling lawful data processing requirements.

## What is a Consent
A consent is fully identified by a source (whoever is consenting), a context (for example, an application), and an action (whatever is consented).
A consent state registers the state of the consent (granted, revoked...).

## Register a new consent
Consent can be given or revoked or changed via the `RegisterConsent` method, which
creates a new `Consent` entity to track the consent.

## Get the current state
Getter methods of this service return the current state of a consent, i.e. the latest [IConsent](https://our.umbraco.com/apidocs/v7/csharp/api/Umbraco.Core.Models.IConsent.html)
entity that was created.

## Revoking a consent
Revoking a consent is performed by registering a revoked consent.

A consent *cannot be deleted*.  It can only be revoked by registering a "revoked consent".

## Examples

```c#
// store a new consent
var newConsent = Services.ConsentService.RegisterConsent("userId", "Our.Custom.Umbraco.Plugin", "AllowedToEmail", ConsentState.Granted, "some comments");

// lookup a consent
var consents = Services.ConsentService.LookupConsent("userId", "Our.Custom.Umbraco.Plugin", "AllowedToEmail", sourceStartsWith : true);
if (consents != null && consents.Any())
{
    var currentConsent = consents.First(c => c.Current == true);
    if(currentConsent.State  == Consentâ€‹State.Granted)
    {
        // Do what you need
    }
    else
    {
        // the state is None, Pending or Revoked
    }
}
```
