# Application startup
The `ApplicationEventHandler` approach for registering events has been removed in Umbraco 8. The new approach for registering custom code at the `ApplicationStarting` and `ApplicationStarted` events uses a combination of 'Composers' and 'Components', you can find a basic example below and more detailed ones on the [Composing](../../Implementation/Composing) page.

Core developer Stephan also has a series of blog posts about the changes:
- [Composing Umbraco v8](https://www.zpqrtbnk.net/posts/composing-umbraco-v8/)
- [Composing Umbraco v8 Collections](https://www.zpqrtbnk.net/posts/composing-umbraco-v8-collections/)
- [Composing Umbraco v8 Components](https://www.zpqrtbnk.net/posts/composing-umbraco-v8-components/)

## Example - Getting started
The following code uses a `ComponentComposer<T>` to add the `ApplicationComponent`. You can optionally override the `Compose()` method if you want to compose more than only adding the component (make sure to keep the call to the base method, as the component isn't added otherwise).    

```csharp
public class ApplicationComposer : ComponentComposer<ApplicationComponent>, IUserComposer
{
	public override void Compose(Composition composition)
	{
        // ApplicationStarting event in V7: add IContentFinders, register custom services and more here

		base.Compose(composition);
	}
}

public class ApplicationComponent : IComponent
{
	public void Initialize()
	{
    	// ApplicationStarted event in V7: add your events here
	}

	public void Terminate()
	{ }
}
```
