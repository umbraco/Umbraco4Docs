# Common issues

_Document to outline commonly found issues with courier, and possible solutions_

### Try this first
For all issues, alwasy try these steps first:
- Enable debugging in /config/courier.config and restart the app to see if courier has problems with loading dlls
- Clear the cache folder in /app_data/courier/cache
- Ensure you have the latest version, current 2.7.8.14

### Get the latest version here:
Nigthly.umbraco.org contains all builds, current recommended version is **2.7.8.35** which contains all the latest 
bug fixes for v4 and v6

http://nightly.umbraco.org/UmbracoCourier/2.7.8/nightly%20builds/

### Key not found exception
*Caused by:* Courier not being able to find a speicific provider, commonly the datalayer provider. Usually because Courier
didnt load the datalater dll or one of its dependencies. 

*How to spot:* Enable debugging in /config/courier.config, restart the app and check the 
/app_data/courier/logs/error_log.txt file for exceptions releated to loading providers. Usually it will say which dll 
had issues loading. 

If no exceptions in the log, it might be missing the dll, or have the dll for the wrong version.

Courier for V6 expects to have umbraco.courier.persistence.v6.nhibernate.dll and for V4 it should have 
umbraco.courier.persistence.v4.nhibernate.dll

*Solution:* Ensure that all dlls are loaded properly, and that it has all the dlls expected. Also, for it should only have
the proper dlls for the specific versions. 

Get the dlls from 2.7.8.14 here: 
http://nightly.umbraco.org/UmbracoCourier/2.7.8/nightly%20builds/

And copy to /bin

### Courier cannot pacage data type, Could not load assembly for type
*Caused by* Courier not able to find a data types assembly or .cs class file which contains the Interface used
by the data type

*How to spot* Courier returns "cannot package GUID from datatypes provider" 

*Solution* Make sure you have all your datatype dependencies in place, usually its ucomponents and similiear projects
that are missing dlls, also, if you dont use a datatype, delete it from your site, so you dont accidently 
transfer a broken datatype. Make sure to clear courier cache and restart application.


### Courier cannot package items on V4
*Caused by:* Missing dlls or dlls from the wrong courier version

*How to spot:* On v6 sites, it has dlls from V4 distribution, on V4 sites it has V6 dlls, or are missing dlls. To debug,
put courier in debug mode in /config/courier.config and restart application, it should throw exceptions to 
/app_data/courier/logs/log_error.txt about missing dependencies or wrong versions

*Solution:* Uninstall courier, and reinstall 2.7.8.14 from nightly:
http://nightly.umbraco.org/UmbracoCourier/2.7.8/nightly%20builds/

### Latest changes arent deployet / courier cant detect changes
*Caused by:* When changes are made, courier stores a serialized copy in its cache folder, in some cases, it cannot update
the filem due to permissions or locks

*How to spot* find the corresponding item in /app_data/courier/cache and see if it changes on save/publish

*Solution:* Clear the /app_data/Courie/cache folder and retry packaging, in some cases caching might need to be turned off
this will make transfers slower, but can be set in /config/courier.config file


### Content are deployed but not published
*Caused by:* Exception during extraction which might get the publish event not to fire

*How to spot:* Content transfers with no error, but changes are not visble on the website

*Solution:* upgrade to 2.7.8.14 which has a bug fix
http://nightly.umbraco.org/UmbracoCourier/2.7.8/nightly%20builds/

### Tabs dont inherite on Umbraco 6
*Caused by:* Changes in the V6 datalayer in the way tabs are inherited from parent document types

*How to spot:* Inherited tabs are created as new tabs on the document type

*Solution:* Upgrade to 2.7.8.14
http://nightly.umbraco.org/UmbracoCourier/2.7.8/nightly%20builds/

### Files on NAS are not transfered
*Caused by:* file paths break the way courier looks up files and cannot find them when transfering

*How to spot:* Files are not included in the revisions

*Solution:* Upgrade to 2.7.8.14

### Files are transfered as 0 byte files
*Caused by:* Courier not able to find file, then loads nothing into the file object

*How to spot:* Files are transfered by end up as 0 byte files on the destination

*Solution:* Fixed issue, Upgrade to 2.7.8.14

### StackOverflowException during deployment
*Caused by:* template or other file starting with the '_' character

*How spot:* Transfer never completes, and the task manager just clears out the task with no errror or feedback

*Solution:* Fixed: Upgrade to 2.7.8.14 


### Properties and tabs are not sorted correctly after transfer
*Caused by:* Umbraco core doesnt register a sortorder on properies and tabs except if they are sorted manually

*How to spot:* Properties and tab changes order after transfer

*Solution:* Sort properties and tabs manually on the source site to ensure the core registers the sort order,
save item and re-transfer to fix


### Courier express cant find repository
*Caused by:* Licensing limitation prohibiting the repository from loading

*How to spot:* Registered repository is not listed in the UI, or you get an exception during packaging

*Solution:* Ensure all registered dlls are allowed in the licensing, upgrade to 2.7.8.14 which is less strict on domain 
restrictions

### Dll is not allowed to call Courier API
*Caused by:* Courier express licensing prohibits 3rd party dlls to call the api, so some dlls were not allowed to 
load

*How to spot:* Save a content item, courier should throw an exception, saying the dll is not allowed to call Couriers
API

*Solution;* upgrade to latest version, since this has been fixed since 2.7.6

### Sort order on documents is not transfered
*Caused by:* Courier not logging sort order changes, due to the way the core does sorting from its api

*How to spot:* Change sorting order on a collection of document, then transfer their parent + children. The sort order will not 
be correct on the destination site

*Solution:* clear the /app_data/courer/cache folder and re-packge the items
