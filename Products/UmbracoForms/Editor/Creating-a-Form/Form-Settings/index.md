### Message on submit
Display some text (staying on the same page)
### Send to page
Selecting a page where the user will be redirected after submitting the form

### Manual Approval
The option to set a form to manual approval, by default a form record will be placed in the approved state after it has been submitted. If you wish to leave it in the submitted state and manually place it in the approves state then check this option (might be usefull if there are workflows that happen on approval).
