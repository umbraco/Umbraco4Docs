Below you'll find some in-depth tutorials on the different ways to install Umbraco.

## [VS Code installation](install-umbraco-with-vs-code.md)

Visual Studio Code is an editor with an embedded webserver (through the IIS Express extension). A fast way to get you up and running with Umbraco.

### [Run Umbraco on IIS](iis.md)

Learn how to run an already installed local installation of Umbraco.

## [.NET CLI installation](install-umbraco-with-templates.md)

.NET CLI, included with the .NET SDK, can be used to install or uninstall .NET templates from NuGet using the `dotnet new` command on any OS. The underlying Template Engine enables the creation of custom templates which make new project bootstrapping much faster. With a few steps you can have an Umbraco project running without the need for a code editor.

## [Visual Studio installation](visual-studio.md)

Visual Studio is used to write native code and managed code supported by .NET and many others.
Its built-in tools provide the ability to develop and execute applications for any platform. Developers will be able to install Umbraco without ever having to leave Visual Studio.

## [Install Umbraco unattended](Unattended-Install.md)

Use the Unattended installs when spinning up Umbraco instances on something like Azure Web Apps to avoid having to run through the installation wizard.
