# Creating forms

Creating forms requires that you know your way around .NET MVC. So if you are familiar with adding view models, views and controllers you are ready to make your first form.

:::note
You can also use [Umbraco forms](https://umbraco.com/products/umbraco-forms/). It lets you and/or your editors create and handle forms in the backoffice. This includes setting up validation, redirecting and storing and sending form data. Great UI, extendable and supported by Umbraco HQ.

In this example we'll create a basic contact form contain name, email and message field.

### Creating the view model

First, we're going to create the model for the contact form by adding a new class to the `/Models` folder. Let's call it `ContactFormViewModel.cs`

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;

namespace MyFirstForm.Models
{
    public class ContactFormViewModel {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Email { get; set; }
        public string Message { get; set; }
    }
}
```

Build your solution after adding the model.

### Creating the view
Next, we add the view for the form to the `/View/Partials` folder. Because we've added the model and built the solution we can add it as a strongly typed view.

Name your view "ContactForm".

The view can be built with standard MVC helpers:

```csharp
@model MyFirstForm.Models.ContactFormViewModel

@using(Html.BeginUmbracoForm("Submit", "ContactForm")) {
    <div>
        @Html.TextBoxFor(m=>m.Name)
    </div>
    <div>
        @Html.TextBoxFor(m=>m.Email)
    </div>
    <div>
        @Html.TextAreaFor(m=>m.Message)
    </div>
    <input type="submit" name="Submit" value="Submit" />
}
```

### Adding the controller
Finally, we're going to add the controller. Add a controller to the `/Controllers` folder, name it `ContactController` and make sure to use an __empty MVC controller__ as the template.

```csharp
using MyFirstForm.Models;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.Mvc;
using Umbraco.Web.Mvc;

namespace MyFirstForm.Controllers
{
    public class ContactFormController : SurfaceController
    {
        [HttpPost]
        public ActionResult Submit(ContactFormViewModel model)
        {
            if (!ModelState.IsValid)
                return CurrentUmbracoPage();

            // Work with form data here

            return RedirectToCurrentUmbracoPage();
        }
    }
}
```

You should note that the controller inherits "SurfaceController" and not from "Controller" as initially added to the file by Visual Studio.

If the model state is invalid, `CurrentUmbracoPage()` will send the user back to the form. If valid, you can work with the form data, e.g. sending an email to site admin and then `RedirectToCurrentUmbracoPage();`.

## Adding the form to a template
You can add the form to a template by rendering the partial view:

```csharp
@using MyFirstForm.Models;

@{
    Html.RenderPartial("~/Views/Partials/ContactForm.cshtml", new ContactFormViewModel());
}
```

## Adding the form through the backoffice
To add the form to your site we'll make a macro. This also makes it possible to let editors add the form to a page using the rich text editor.

#### Creating a macro
Go to the developer section and right click the menu icon on the __Partial Views Macro Files__ node. Name the macro *Contact Form*, select an empty snippet and leave the __Create Macro__ checkbox checked.

In the partial view, we're going to render our contact form using the view model we created earlier.

```csharp
@inherits Umbraco.Web.Macros.PartialViewMacroPage

@using MyFirstForm.Models;

@{
    Html.RenderPartial("~/Views/Partials/ContactForm.cshtml", new ContactFormViewModel());
}
```


#### Adding the macro
The last thing to do before we can add the form to a page is to **allow the Macro in a rich text editor**.
Select the expand the __Macros__ node and select the __Contact Form__ Macro. Check the boxes under __Editor Settings__.

Now you can add the form to a page that has a rich text editor.
