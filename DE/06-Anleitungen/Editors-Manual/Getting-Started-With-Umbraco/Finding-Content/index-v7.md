# Finding Content

The Umbraco content tree view allows you to navigate web pages through a logical site hierarchy. You can find a page by navigating through the tree itself if you know where the page is stored. Alternatively a quicker approach might be to perform a search across the entire content tree view. Using the search bar you can enter a search term and Umbraco will search for pages containing the term anywhere in the page name or page content.
