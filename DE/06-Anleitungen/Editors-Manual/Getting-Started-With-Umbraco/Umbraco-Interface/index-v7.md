# Umbraco Interface

## Initial View

Once you have logged in you will enter the Content section of Umbraco. There are several sections within Umbraco that allow you to manage different aspects of your site. The Content section allows you to manage the web pages of your site. Sections may vary from user to user based upon their role. As an editor or writer for instance you may only have access to the Content and Media sections. You can navigate between sections using the black section bar on the left-hand side of the screen. As you rollover one of the sections the name of the section will be revealed. Click a section to navigate to it.

To the right of the section bar is the tree view which shows the structure of your website. To navigate the tree you can click on the black arrows to the left of tree items which will reveal any sub-pages. Clicking on the
page name will load that pageâ€™s content into the large content area on the right of the tree view.

## Behaviour at Smaller Screen Sizes

By default, on a desktop with a large screen size, the tree view is always visible giving you quick access
to select and navigate website content. On smaller devices such as laptops and tablets, the tree view will be closed and only opens after you click on one of the navigation icons in the section bar on the left of the screen.

After selecting an item within the tree view on a smaller device, it will automatically close to save screen space. If you wish to close the tree view without selecting a page, you can move your mouse out of the tree view, or alternatively on a touch device you can swipe left over the tree view. Below are examples of how the interface will look on a tablet.
