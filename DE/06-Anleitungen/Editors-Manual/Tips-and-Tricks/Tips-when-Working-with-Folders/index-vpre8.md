# Refreshing the Tree View

When editing content, the content tree will generally refresh itself when content is saved. If the tree doesnâ€™t refresh, or if multiple editors are working on the site, and you want to have their changes loaded into your content tree, you can do this by reloading parts of the content tree. To reload a section of the content tree, right-click on an item in the tree, and choose the ***Reload nodes*** option from the context menu. Choosing this option causes the content tree to refresh itself and its child nodes to reflect any new changes.
