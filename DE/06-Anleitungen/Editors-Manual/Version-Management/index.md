# Version Management

Umbraco allows you to work with multiple versions of the same page. All previously saved pages are stored in a version history list. In this section, you will find information on how to compare versions or roll back different versions of content:

  - [Comparing Versions](Comparing-Versions/index.md)

  - [Rollback to a Previous Version](Rollback-to-a-Previous-Versions/index.md)
