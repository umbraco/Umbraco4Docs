# CSS and Images

Our homepage is currently missing the CSS and image files. To include these files:

1. Navigate to the **Umbraco Installation** folder and the **Custom Umbraco Template** folder in File Explorer.
2. Copy the **css** and **images** folders from the Custom Umbraco template folder to the Umbraco Installation folder.
3. Using Chrome/Firefox/Edge Developer Tools, start or refresh your `http://localhost:xxxx.`

    The network tab should not report any missing css or images files. If the network tab reports any error, check for typos and if the folders are in the right places.
