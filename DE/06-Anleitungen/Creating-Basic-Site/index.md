# Creating a Basic Website using Umbraco

_This tutorial was last tested on **Umbraco 10.0.0+**_

## Introduction

This tutorial will take you step by step through an Umbraco website build. It will allow you to take any website "template" (e.g. flat HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and install it into a fresh Umbraco site and wire up the sections that need content managing by Umbraco.  

We will avoid using any starter kits in this tutorial. Although these are extremely useful, they wonâ€™t provide you with an understanding of the basics of Umbraco, such as Document Types and Templates and how these work together to build pages.

It is recommended that you work through the subsections in the following order.

## [Getting Started](Getting-Started)

## [Displaying the Document Type Properties](Displaying-the-Document-Type-Properties)

## [Articles Parent and Article Items](Articles-Parent-and-Article-Items)

How to have a parent page that lists and links to child nodes automatically (e.g. an article list page containing a flexible/infinite number of articles - useful for Blogs or News pages).

## [Adding Language Variants](Adding-Language-Variants)

At this point we have a basic site, but wouldn't it be cool if we could make the same site in another language? Read on to see how to get started with Language Variants!

## [Conclusions and Where Next?](Conclusions-Where-Next)

By this point you'll have a basic working site - but where to next?  You've barely scratched the surface of the power of Umbraco - a few links to send you on your way!
