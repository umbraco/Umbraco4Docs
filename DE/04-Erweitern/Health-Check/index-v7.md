# Health Check

The developer section of the Umbraco backoffice holds a dashboard named "Health Check". It is a handy list of checks to see if your Umbraco installation is configured according to best practices. It's possible to add your custom built health checks.
This feature has been available since Umbraco version 7.5.

For inspiration when building your own checks you can look at the checks we've [built into Umbraco](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/tree/v7/dev/src/Umbraco.Web/HealthCheck/Checks). Some examples will follow in this document.

## Built-in checks

Umbraco comes with the following checks by default:

* Category **Configuration**
  * **Macro errors (id: `D0F7599E-9B2A-4D9E-9883-81C7EDC5616F`)** - checks that the errors are set to `inline` so that pages that error will still load (and shows a small error message)
  * **Notification Email Settings (id: `3E2F7B14-4B41-452B-9A30-E67FBC8E1206`)** - checks that the "from" email address used for email notifications has been changed from its default value
  * **Try Skip IIS Custom Errors (id: `046A066C-4FB2-4937-B931-069964E16C66`)** - in IIS 7.5 and higher this should be set to `true`
* Category **Data Integrity**
  * **Data integrity (id: `D999EB2B-64C2-400F-B50C-334D41F8589A`)** - validates the XML structures for content, media and members that are stored in the `cmsContentXml` table
* Category **Live environment**
  * **Custom errors (id: `4090C0A1-2C52-4124-92DD-F028FD066A64`)** - should be set to `RemoteOnly` or `On` on your live site
  * **Trace mode (id: `9BED6EF4-A7F3-457A-8935-B64E9AA8BAB3`)** - should be set to `enabled="false"` on your live site
  * **Debug compilation mode (id: `61214FF3-FC57-4B31-B5CF-1D095C977D6D`)** - should be set to `debug="false"` on your live site
* Category **Permissions**
  * **Folder & file permissions (id: `53DBA282-4A79-4B67-B958-B29EC40FCC23`)** - checks that folders and files that are either required or recommended to set with write permissions can be accessed
* Category **Security**
  * **Click-Jacking Protection (id: `ED0D7E40-971E-4BE8-AB6D-8CC5D0A6A5B0`)** - checks to see if a header or meta-tag is in place to indicate whether the site can be hosted in an IFRAME.  Normally this is best set to deny permission for this to be done, to prevent what is known as [click-jacking](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking) attacks
  * **Excessive Headers (id: `92ABBAA2-0586-4089-8AE2-9A843439D577`)** - checks to ensure that various headers that can provide details about the technology used to build and host the website have been removed
  * **HTTPS check (id: `EB66BB3B-1BCD-4314-9531-9DA2C1D6D9A7`)** - to determine if the current site is running on a secure connection
  * **UmbracoUseSSL check** - when the site is running on HTTPS, `umbracoUseSSL` needs to be enabled to secure the backoffice
  * **HTTPS connectivity check** - when connecting to the site over HTTPS, does it return a valid response (i.e. the certificate has not expired)?
* Category **Services**
  * **SMTP settings (id: `1B5D221B-CE99-4193-97CB-5F3261EC73DF`)** - checks that an SMTP server is configured and is accepting requests for sending emails

Each check returns a message indicating whether or not the issue in question has been found on the website installation. This could be an error that should be fixed, or a warning you should be aware of.

Some of them can also be rectified via the dashboard, by clicking the **Fix** button and in some cases providing some required information.  These changes usually involve writing to configuration files that will often trigger a restart of the website.

## Configuring and scheduling checks

As well as viewing the results of health checks via the Developer section dashboard, you can set up the checks to be run on a schedule and be notified of the results by email.  It's also possible to disable certain checks if they aren't applicable in your environment.

For more on this see the [Reference > Config > Health checks page](../../Reference/Config/HealthChecks/index.md).

## Custom checks

You can build your own health checks. There are two types of health checks you can build: **configuration checks** and **general checks**.

Each health check is a class that needs to have a `HealthCheck` attribute. This attribute has a few things you need to fill in:

* GUID - a unique ID that you've generated for this specific check
* Name - give it a short name so people know what the check is for
* Description - describes what the check does in detail
* Group - this is the category for the check if you use an existing group name (like "Configuration") the check will be added in that category, otherwise a new category will appear in the dashboard

### Configuration checks

These are small checks that take an XPath query and confirm that the value that's expected is there. If the value is not correct, clicking the "Rectify" button will set the recommended value.

* A configuration check needs to inherit from `Umbraco.Web.HealthCheck.Checks.Config.AbstractConfigCheck`
* A configuration check needs the `HealthCheck` attribute as noted at the start of this document
* `FilePath` is the relative path to which config file you want to check
* `XPath` is the query you want to execute to find the configuration value you want to verify
* `ValueComparisonType` can either be `ValueComparisonType.ShouldEqual` or `ValueComparisonType.ShouldNotEqual`
* `Values` is a list of values that are available for this configuration item - in this example it can be `RemoteOnly` or `On`, they're both acceptable for a live site.
  * For checks using the `ShouldEqual` comparison method, make sure to set one of these values to `IsRecommended = true` - when the "Fix" button is pressed, the recommended value will be stored
  * Where `ShouldNotEqual` is used the fix will require the user to provide the correct setting
* `CheckSuccessMessage`, `CheckErrorMessage` and `RectifySuccessMessage` are the messages returned to the user
  * It is highly recommended to use the `LocalizedTextService` so these can be localized. You can add the text in `~/Config/Lang/en-US.user.xml` (or whatever language you like)
  * Don't add the translations to `~/Umbraco/Config/Lang` files, the correct location is `~/Config/Lang/*-*.user.xml`

An example check:

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using Umbraco.Core.Services;

namespace Umbraco.Web.HealthCheck.Checks.Config
{
    [HealthCheck("D0F7599E-9B2A-4D9E-9883-81C7EDC5616F", "Macro errors",
        Description = "Checks to make sure macro errors are not set to throw a YSOD (yellow screen of death), which would prevent certain or all pages from loading completely.",
        Group = "Configuration")]
    public class MacroErrorsCheck : AbstractConfigCheck
    {
        private readonly ILocalizedTextService _textService;

        public MacroErrorsCheck(HealthCheckContext healthCheckContext) : base(healthCheckContext)
        {
            _textService = healthCheckContext.ApplicationContext.Services.TextService;
        }

        public override string FilePath
        {
            get { return "~/Config/umbracoSettings.config"; }
        }

        public override string XPath
        {
            get { return "/settings/content/MacroErrors"; }
        }

        public override ValueComparisonType ValueComparisonType
        {
            get { return ValueComparisonType.ShouldEqual; }
        }

        public override IEnumerable<AcceptableConfiguration> Values
        {
            get
            {
                var values = new List<AcceptableConfiguration>
                {
                    new AcceptableConfiguration
                    {
                        IsRecommended = true,
                        Value = "inline"
                    },
                    new AcceptableConfiguration
                    {
                        IsRecommended = false,
                        Value = "silent"
                    }
                };

                return values;
            }
        }

        public override string CheckSuccessMessage
        {
            get
            {
                return _textService.Localize("healthcheck/macroErrorModeCheckSuccessMessage",
                    new[] { CurrentValue, Values.First(v => v.IsRecommended).Value });
            }
        }

        public override string CheckErrorMessage
        {
            get
            {
                return _textService.Localize("healthcheck/macroErrorModeCheckErrorMessage",
                    new[] { CurrentValue, Values.First(v => v.IsRecommended).Value });
            }
        }

        public override string RectifySuccessMessage
        {
            get
            {
                return _textService.Localize("healthcheck/macroErrorModeCheckRectifySuccessMessage",
                    new[] { Values.First(v => v.IsRecommended).Value });
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### General checks
This can be anything you can think of, the results and the rectify action are completely under your control.

* A general check needs to inherit from `Umbraco.Web.HealthCheck.HealthCheck`
* A general check needs the `HealthCheck` attribute as noted at the start of this document
* All checks run when the dashboard is loaded, this means that the `GetStatus()` method gets executed
  * You can return multiple status checks from `GetStatus()`
* A status check returns a `HealthCheckStatus`
  * If a `HealthCheckStatus` has a `HealthCheckAction` defined then the "Fix" button will perform that action once clicked
  * Sometimes, the button to fix something should not be called "Fix", change the `Name` property of a `HealthCheckAction` to provide a better name
  * `HealthCheckAction` has a `Description` property so that you can provide information on what clicking the "Rectify" button will do (or provide links to documentation, for example)
  * `HealthCheckStatus` has a few result levels:
    * `StatusResultType.Success`
    * `StatusResultType.Error`
    * `StatusResultType.Warning`
    * `StatusResultType.Info`
  * A `HealthCheckAction` needs to provide an alias for an action that can be picked up in the `ExecuteAction` method
* It is highly recommended to use the `LocalizedTextService` so text can be localized. You can add the text in `~/Config/Lang/en-US.user.xml` (or whatever language you like)
* Don't add the translations to `~/Umbraco/Config/Lang` files, the correct location is `~/Config/Lang/*-*.user.xml`

    Group = "SEO")]
    public class RobotsTxt : HealthCheck
    {
        private readonly ILocalizedTextService _textService;

        public RobotsTxt(HealthCheckContext healthCheckContext) : base(healthCheckContext)
        {
            _textService = healthCheckContext.ApplicationContext.Services.TextService;
        }

        public override IEnumerable<HealthCheckStatus> GetStatus()
        {
            return new[] { CheckForRobotsTxtFile() };
        }

        public override HealthCheckStatus ExecuteAction(HealthCheckAction action)
        {
            switch (action.Alias)
            {
                case "addDefaultRobotsTxtFile":
                    return AddDefaultRobotsTxtFile();
                default:
                    throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException();
            }
        }

        private HealthCheckStatus CheckForRobotsTxtFile()
        {
            var success = File.Exists(HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath("~/robots.txt"));
            var message = success
                ? _textService.Localize("healthcheck/seoRobotsCheckSuccess")
                : _textService.Localize("healthcheck/seoRobotsCheckFailed");

            var actions = new List<HealthCheckAction>();

            if (success == false)
                actions.Add(new HealthCheckAction("addDefaultRobotsTxtFile", Id)
                // Override the "Rectify" button name and describe what this action will do
                { Name = _textService.Localize("healthcheck/seoRobotsRectifyButtonName"),
                    Description = _textService.Localize("healthcheck/seoRobotsRectifyDescription") });

            return
                new HealthCheckStatus(message)
                {
                    ResultType = success ? StatusResultType.Success : StatusResultType.Error,
                    Actions = actions
                };
        }

        private HealthCheckStatus AddDefaultRobotsTxtFile()
        {

                    ResultType = success ? StatusResultType.Success : StatusResultType.Error,
                    Actions = new List<HealthCheckAction>()
                };
        }
    }
}
```
## Custom health check notifications

Health check notifications can be scheduled to run periodically and notify you of the results. Included with Umbraco is a notification method to deliver the results via email. In a similar manner to how it's possible to create your own health checks, you can also create custom notification methods to send the message summarising the status of the health checks via other means.  Again, for further details on implementing this on this please refer the [existing notification methods within the core code base](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/tree/v7/dev/src/Umbraco.Web/HealthCheck/NotificationMethods).

Each notification method needs to implement the core interface `IHealthCheckNotificatationMethod` and, for ease of creation, can inherit from the base class `NotificationMethodBase`. The class must also be decorated with an instance of the `HealthCheckNotificationMethod` attribute. There's one method to implement - `SendAsync(HealthCheckResults results)` - which is responsible for taking the results of the health checks and sending them via the mechanism of your choice.

The following example shows how the core method for sending notification via email is implemented:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Net.Mail;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Umbraco.Core;
using Umbraco.Core.Configuration;
using Umbraco.Core.Configuration.HealthChecks;
using Umbraco.Core.Services;

namespace Umbraco.Web.HealthCheck.NotificationMethods
{
    [HealthCheckNotificationMethod("email")]
    public class EmailNotificationMethod : NotificationMethodBase, IHealthCheckNotificatationMethod
    {
        private readonly ILocalizedTextService _textService;

        public EmailNotificationMethod(bool enabled, bool failureOnly, HealthCheckNotificationVerbosity verbosity,
                string recipientEmail)
            : this(enabled, failureOnly, verbosity, recipientEmail, ApplicationContext.Current.Services.TextService)
        {
        }

        internal EmailNotificationMethod(bool enabled, bool failureOnly, HealthCheckNotificationVerbosity verbosity,
            string recipientEmail, ILocalizedTextService textService)
            : base(enabled, failureOnly, verbosity)
        {
            if (textService == null) throw new ArgumentNullException("textService");
            _textService = textService;
            RecipientEmail = recipientEmail;
            Verbosity = verbosity;
        }

        public string RecipientEmail { get; private set; }

        public async Task SendAsync(HealthCheckResults results)
        {
            if (ShouldSend(results) == false)
            {
                return;
            }

            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(RecipientEmail))
            {
                return;
            }

            var message = _textService.Localize("healthcheck/scheduledHealthCheckEmailBody", new[]
            {
                DateTime.Now.ToShortDateString(),
                DateTime.Now.ToShortTimeString(),
                results.ResultsAsHtml(Verbosity)
            });

            var subject = _textService.Localize("healthcheck/scheduledHealthCheckEmailSubject");

            var mailSender = new EmailSender();
            using (var mailMessage = new MailMessage(UmbracoConfig.For.UmbracoSettings().Content.NotificationEmailAddress,
                RecipientEmail,
                string.IsNullOrEmpty(subject) ? "Umbraco Health Check Status" : subject,
                message)
            {
                IsBodyHtml = message.IsNullOrWhiteSpace() == false
                                && message.Contains("<") && message.Contains("</")
            })
            {
                await mailSender.SendAsync(mailMessage);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If custom configuration is required for a custom notification method, this can be placed in `HealthChecks.config`, with the `alias` XML attribute for the `notificationMethod` element matching that used on the class level attribute. Again, the following extract shows how the email notification method is configured:

```xml
<HealthChecks>
    <notificationSettings enabled="true" firstRunTime="" periodInHours="24">
    <notificationMethods>
        <notificationMethod alias="email" enabled="true" verbosity="Summary">
        <settings>
            <add key="recipientEmail" value="alerts@mywebsite.tld" />
        </settings>
        </notificationMethod>
    </notificationMethods>
    </notificationSettings>
</HealthChecks>
```
