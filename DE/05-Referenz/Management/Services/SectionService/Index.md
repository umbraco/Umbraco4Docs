# SectionService
The Umbraco backoffice consists of Sections, also referred to as Applications.

In previous versions the SectionService was used to control/query the storage for section registrations in the ~/Config/applications.config file. This config file no longer exists in the current version and therefore the SectionService has become unnecessary.
