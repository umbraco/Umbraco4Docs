# DynamicPublishedContent

DynamicPublishedContent is the dynamic version of [IPublishedContent](../IPublishedContent/index.md), it allows for simpler access to property data
but it does not provide [intellisense](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hcw1s69b.aspx). All methods and properties that are available on IPublishedContent are also available
on DynamicPublishedContent. However, there are a few special methods specifically designed for DynamicPublishedContent
that are used for filtering, querying and collections.

## Get started
To access the current page in your macros or templates, copy-paste the below Razor code.

```csharp
@{
    var pageName = CurrentPage.Name;
    var childPages = CurrentPage.Children;
}

<h1>@pageName</h1>
```
## [Properties](Properties.md)
Listing and explanation of DynamicPublishedContent properties & standard helpers for Content and Media.

## [Collections & Filtering](Collections.md)
Methods for DynamicPublishedContent collections and filtering.

## [IsHelpers](../IPublishedContent/IsHelpers.md)
A library of extension methods to simplify working with DynamicPublishedContents in collections to modify your HTML output.
Examples could be injecting CSS classes for alternating rows or to modify margins.
