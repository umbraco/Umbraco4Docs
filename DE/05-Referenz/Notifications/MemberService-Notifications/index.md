# MemberService Notifications

:::note
If you are using Umbraco 8 or any lower version, please refer to the [MemberService Events](../Events/MemberService-Events) article instead.
:::

The MemberService implements IMemberService and provides access to operations involving IMember.

## Usage

```C#
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Events;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Services.Notifications;

namespace MySite
{
    public class MemberNotificationHandler : INotificationHandler<MemberSavedNotification>
    {
        private readonly ILogger<MemberNotificationHandler> _logger;

        public MemberNotificationHandler(ILogger<MemberNotificationHandler> logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }
        
        public void Handle(MemberSavedNotification notification)
        {
            foreach (var member in notification.SavedEntities)
            {
                // Write to the logs every time a member is saved.
                _logger.LogInformation("Member {member} has been saved and notification published!", member.Name);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
