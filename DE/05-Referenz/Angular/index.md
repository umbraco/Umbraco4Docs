# AngularJS

Since Umbraco 7, the Umbraco backoffice has been built using AngularJS. The implementation is made up of many directives and services.

:::note
As of Umbraco 10, this section will no longer be updated.

Please refer to the auto-generated [API Documentation for the Umbraco backoffice](https://apidocs.umbraco.com/v9/ui) instead.

If you have any questions regarding the above, feel free to reach out at docs@umbraco.com or raise an issue on the [official UmbracoDocs GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/umbraco/UmbracoDocs/issues).
:::

Generally, you can find information about these via the [Backoffice UI API documentation](https://apidocs.umbraco.com/v9/ui). While this part of the documentation is auto-generated from the Umbraco source code, you can also find below some more in-depth description and examples for these directives and services.

## Directives

- [Layout selector](Directives/umbLayoutSelector/) (`<umbLayoutSelector />`)
- [Load indicator](Directives/umbLoadIndicator/) (`<umbLoadIndicator />`)
- [Property](Directives/umbProperty/) (`<umbProperty />`)

## Services

- [Editor service](Services/editorService/)
- [Events service](Services/eventsService/)

## [UI Examples](https://our.umbraco.com/packages/developer-tools/ui-examples/)

There is a package available called 'UI Examples'. This package adds a new 'UI Examples' section to your Umbraco instance with working examples of how to customise the backoffice.
