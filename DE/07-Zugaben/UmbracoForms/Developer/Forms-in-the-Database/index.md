# Umbraco Forms in the Database

In Umbraco Forms version 9.0.0+, it is *only* possible to store Form data in the database.

If you are upgrading to Umbraco 9 and using Forms, you should first migrate the Forms to the database using Forms 8. For more information on migrating your Umbraco Forms data to the database, see the [Umbraco Forms in the Database version 8.0.0+](../Forms-in-the-Database/index-v8) article.
