# Upgrading - version specific

This page covers specific upgrade documentation for specific versions.

## Version 10

Version 10 of Umbraco Forms has a minimum dependency on Umbraco CMS core of `10.0.0`. It runs on .NET 6.

To migrate to version 10 you should first update to the latest minor release of version 9. This will ensure you have all the database schema changes in place.

### Breaking changes

Version 10 contains a number of breaking changes but we won't expect many projects to be affected by them as they are in areas that are not typical extension points. For reference though, the full details are listed here.

#### Views and client-side files

Umbraco 10 distributes the views and client-side files as part of a Razor class library, distributed in the Umbraco.Forms.StaticAssets package.  This means these assets are no longer individual files available on disk. The advantage of this approach is that that avoids changes made to them by solution developers being inadvertently lost when the project is rebuilt.

When upgrading from Forms 9, you should either first run a `dotnet clean`, or, after installing Forms 10, delete the `App_Plugins/UmbracoForms` folder.  This will ensure there aren't two copies of the `package.manifest` file, which would cause issues by registering duplicate property editors.

#### Configuration

- Renamed the configuration option to allow editable form submissions on the front-end to `AllowEditableFormSubmisisons` (fixing the typo in the previous value of `AllowEditableFormSubmisisons`).

#### Code

- `DatabaseIntegrityHealthCheck` has an altered constructor taking an additional parameter.
- The `EventExtensions` class is no longer used since V9 and has been removed.
- Static events from `BaseFileStorage` removed and replaced with notifications.
- `IFormTemplateStorage` along with its implementation in `FormTemplateStorage` and base classes have been simplified, as templates are the only file based storage now in use, and there are no methods necessary for this other than reading.
- The method `GetScaffold` has been removed from `FormController`, as it's not called from the UI.
- The following classes have altered constructors taking additional parameters, with obsolete versions removed.
  - `RecordController`
  - `FormSecurityController`
  - `FormSecurityTreeController`
  - `PostToUrl`
  - `WorkflowEmailService`
- The public fields on the `Setting` class have been converted to properties.
- The methods `GetMemberCacheKey` and `GetMemberValuesCacheKey` on` CacheKeys` taking an integer parameter have been removed.
- The method `GetUserSecurity` on `IUserSecurityStorage` has been amended to take an integer parameter rather than an object.
- The method `StringExtensions.DetectIsJson` has been removed (the equivalent exists in CMS).
- Obsoleted methods in `FieldConditionEvaluation` have been removed.
- The following unused classes have been removed:
  - `FormEventArgs`
  - `FolderEventArgs`
  - `FieldPreValueSourceEventArgs`
  - `FormDataSourceEventArgs`
  - `WorkflowEventArgs`
  - `BaseStorageEventArgs`
Additional methods have been added to the following interfaces:
 - `IRecordStorage`
 - `IRecordFieldValueStorage`
 - `IUserSecurityStorage`
 - `IUserFormSecurityStorage`
 - `IFormsSecurity`
- Additional properties of `SupportsMandatory` and `EditType` have been added to the `IFieldType` interface.
- The obsoleted method `RegenerateFieldSetAndFieldIds` on `Form` has been removed,
- The constructor of `FolderNotificationHandler` had an unused parameter removed.
- The obsolete and unused methods `CanCurrentUserEdit`, `CanCurrentUserAddInEditor`, `CanCurrentUserManageWorkflows`, `EnsureUserExist`s and `CanCurrentUserExport` were removed from the `IFormSecurity` interface.
- The type parameter `TEventArgs` defined on `IBaseService` (and derived interfaces) has been removed.
- Database migration classes inheriting from `FormsMigrationBase` now use the non-obsolete base constructor defined on `PackageMigrationBase`.
- The methods on `IPlaceholderParsingService` have been combined into a single one with optional parameters.
- The method `PostSave` on `FormSecurityController` has been renamed to `PostSaveForUser`.
- The back-office model class `FormSecurity` has been renamed to `FormSecurityForUser`.
- The unused class `NonSerialiazableTypeSurrogateSelector` was removed.
- The unused method `ImportXmlNodeFromText` on `XmlHelper` was  removed.
- `IFormService.FormExist` was renamed to `IFormService.FormExists`.
- `EntrySearchResultCollection.schema` was capitalized.
- Base class `ExportType` has a constructor taking `IHostEnvironment` instead of `IHostingEnvironment`.
- Typo was fixed in the class name of `TempDataDictionraryExtensions`.
- The `SetFormThemeCssFile` extension method had an unused variable removed.
- Various method signatures have had appropriate modifications for nullable reference type support.
- Removed `BaseFileStorage`, `BaseFileSystemStorage` and `FormsFileSystemForPackageData` as they are no longer needed following changes to support distribution of assets in a razor class library.

## Version 9

Version 9 of Umbraco Forms has a minimum dependency on Umbraco CMS core of `9.0.1` and runs on .NET 5.

## Version 8

Version 8 of Umbraco Forms has a minimum dependency on Umbraco CMS core of `8.0.0` and runs on .NET Framework 7.2.
The reasoning behind this is due to some underlying changes in Umbraco CMS core.

In order to upgrade from Umbraco Forms 7 to Umbraco Forms 8 make sure you read the [Manual Upgrade instructions](ManualUpgrade).

## Version 4 to Version 6

Upgrading to Version 6 of Umbraco Forms, has a higher minimum dependency on Umbraco CMS core of `7.6.0` & higher. The reasoning behind this is due to some underlying changes to ensure Forms works with Umbraco Cloud & Deploy.

With Umbraco you have many options to upgrade Umbraco Forms.

* You can install the Forms package via the community package search from within the Developer Tab in the CMS
* Umbraco Forms can be downloaded directly from [our.umbraco.com](https://our.umbraco.com/packages/developer-tools/umbraco-forms/)
* You can download a ZIP file containing the updated files which you can unzip & apply over the top of your existing install
* You can upgrade Forms using NuGet. Doing this will require a few more steps, which you can find in the next section

### Upgrading with NuGet

Using NuGet to perform an Upgrade of Umbraco Forms to the next major version, you will run into a problem where the legacy MacroPartial view file will be removed from the site. This causes any existing Umbraco Forms rendered on the site to stop functioning.
Before running the site after the NuGet upgrade again; consider this may need to be done on each environment depending on your deployment process/setup. You will need to copy/restore the following file `Views/MacroPartials/InsertUmbracoForm.cshtml` from your source control solution.

The file needs to be here before the site is restarted - due to the migration/upgrade tasks listed below.

For new & clean installs done with NuGet this will not be a problem for you, as only the new Macro & its associated MacroPartial view file is part of the new NuGet version.


### Upgrade tasks
The following outlines for `version 6.0.0` what upgrade/migration tasks that are being performed:

* Rename legacy macro to make it easier to identify in the backoffice
* Adds new form macro to insert a form with a theme
* Moves JSON Form Storage files from `App_Plugins/UmbracoForms/Data` to `App_Data/UmbracoForms/Data` by default unless a custom Forms IFileSystem is configured such as Azure blob storage
* Moves any Form PreValue sources that uses text files that were uploaded to the media section & now stores in the Umbraco Forms IFileSystem

### Recommendation
We highly recommend you make the switch away from the legacy macro and swap over to the newer macro that supports the new 6.0.0 feature of themes. The legacy macro is there to ease the transition over and to avoid entire sites forms to stop working.
