## Payment and Invoices

On Umbraco Cloud, we are sending out one single invoice with all the projects that you are paying for via email every month.

If you want to watch the Payment history and download an invoice from a previous month, you do this from the Payment setting in the dropdown menu on your projects.

From here you can see a history of the payments that have been done on the respective project that you are looking at.

You can see the Invoice number, the date the invoice was issued, the total amount that has been paid, and the payment status, as well as change which Credit card you are using to pay for the specific project.

When downloading an invoice for a given month, the invoice will contain all the projects that you were paying for during the month.
