# Upload Custom Certificates Manually

:::note
This feature is *only* available for Umbraco Cloud projects on a **Professional** or **Enterprise** plan.

All projects on Starter, Standard, or Professional plans will automatically be assigned a TLS (HTTPS) certificate.

See the full list of features in the [Umbraco Cloud Pricing Plans](https://umbraco.com/umbraco-cloud-pricing/) on the Umbraco website.
:::

To manually upload your own certificate on the Umbraco Cloud Portal and assign it to one of the hostnames you've added:

1. Go to your project on the Umbraco Cloud portal.
2. Click **Settings** -> **Certificates**. The **Manual Certificates** window opens.

Your certificates need to be:

1. In **`.pfx`** format.
2. Must use a password.
3. Cannot be expired.
4. Signature algorithm must be SHA256WithRSA, SHA1WithRSA or ECDSAWithSHA256

The **`.pfx`** file can only contain one certificate. Each certificate can then be bound to a hostname you have already added to your site. Make sure you use the hostname you will bind the certificate to as the Common Name (CN) when generating the certificate.

## Add Manual certificate

* Select **Choose file** in the **Certificate (.pfx file)** field and upload your certificate from your local machine.
* Enter the **Password** for your certificate.

* Click **Add**

## Bind Certificate to a Hostname

* Click **Add new binding**
* Choose your hostname from the *Hostname* dropdown
* Choose your newly uploaded certificate from the *Certificate* dropdown
* Click **Add**

You've now successfully added your certificate to the Cloud project.

## From Custom Certificate to Automatic TLS (HTTPS)

In some cases, you might want to switch from using your own custom certificate, to use the ones provided by the Umbraco Cloud service.

By removing your own certificate from your Cloud project, the Umbraco Cloud service will automatically assign a new TLS (HTTPS) certificate to the hostname.

:::note
Did your manually uploaded security certificate expire?

You will need to remove the expired certificate in order for Umbraco Cloud to assign a new certificate to your hostname(s).
