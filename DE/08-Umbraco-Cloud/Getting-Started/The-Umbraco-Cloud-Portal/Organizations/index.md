# Organizations on Umbraco Cloud

On Umbraco Cloud, you are able to get an Umbraco Cloud Organization. With an Organization, you get an overview of all the projects that have been created by you and the members of your Organization.

If you are interested in getting an Organization, please reach out to our Support Team through the Chat box in your project overview.

## Managing your Organization
