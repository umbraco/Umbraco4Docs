# Source Control

## Umbraco Cloud

If you are running your site on Umbraco Cloud - and why wouldn't you be? - then source control is very much part of the experience, have a look at the ['Technical overview of an Umbraco Cloud Environment'](../../../Umbraco-Cloud/Getting-Started/Environments/) and the information on ['Working with your Umbraco Cloud project'](../../../Umbraco-Cloud/Set-Up/#working-with-your-umbraco-cloud-project) for a steer on Source/Version Control good practices.

## Outside of Umbraco Cloud

If you are hosting your Umbraco implementation outside of Umbraco Cloud, it's generally considered good practice to setup source/version control for your site implementation files. This is especially a good idea when you are working with a team as it can help you track changes and manage conflicts with other developer's work.

So if you've made the decision to try to attempt to source/version control your Umbraco implementation work, perhaps setting up a ['Git Repository'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) - then a frequently asked question is:

### What folders and files should I **exclude** from my source control repository?

There are lots of different possible variations within your working environment that will affect the best way to setup version control. It depends on whether you are:

- Working with a team of developers,
- How you have installed Umbraco,
- How your development environment is setup,
- Source control repository,
- And also how you intend to build and deploy your solution to your target production environment (build servers, Web Deploy or good old FTP etc).

This documentation can't be an exhaustive list of how to version control Umbraco in all possible scenarios. Hopefully it will give you an insight into the anatomy of how an Umbraco website hangs together and therefore which parts to include in version control and which parts not to.

![Typical set of Umbraco Project Folders](images/app-data-folders-version8.png)

#### The Umbraco Folder

The main folder where the Umbraco CMS resides in, is the `/umbraco` one inside your project.

The contents change when you upgrade Umbraco, but no part of your implementation or third party packages installed should update this folder. Historically that has not always been the case, and in the past icons and plugins have been added within this folder.

If you are using NuGet to manage this package inside your solution, this should not need to be source controlled.
If you are working with Visual Studio and a Build Server, it's NuGet's job to restore the correct versions of this folder for you. You shouldn't include this folder in your Visual Studio project, as there is a build step, that ensures it is 'deployed' along with your solution when using Web Deploy.

#### App_Data Folders

![App_Data Folders](images/typical-umbraco-project-folders-version8.png)

When Umbraco is running it will generate and update some files on disk:

- For image caching purposes,
- Logging,
- Site search indexes,
- And the published cache file amongst others.

Unless configured otherwise, these will be created in the `/App_Data` folder of your application, and do not need to be source controlled.

They include:

- `cache` - *ImageProcessor* ships with Umbraco and when an image is requested via the processor, eg to be resized or cropped, a cached version of the transformed image will be stored in this folder. (The *ImageProcessor* Config `/config/imageprocessor/cache.config` allows you to determine where this cache is stored)
- `Logs` - Umbraco currently uses *Serilog*, and a file will be generated in this folder containing tracelogs of your application, one JSON file for each day.
- `NuGetBackup` - If you've installed or upgraded Umbraco via NuGet, then a backup of files before they were replaced will be copied here.
- `Temp` - as the name suggests, temporary no need to source control.
  - `ClientDependency`, Umbraco uses the *[Client Dependency Framework](https://github.com/Shazwazza/ClientDependency)*, to minimise and combine css/js resources into single requests for use in the Umbraco backoffice - a cache of the processed resources are maintained in this folder.
  - `ExamineIndexes`, Umbraco uses *[Examine](../../../Reference/Searching/Examine/)* (a provider based Indexer/Searcher API that wraps the Lucene.Net indexing/searching engine) to index content and members for the Umbraco backoffice search, unless configured otherwise the indexes will be generated in this folder.
  - `PluginCache` - a hash and list of the plugins installed in your implementation, for detection of changes at startup.
- `Umbraco.sdf` - If you are using SQLCE for the data store in your Umbraco site, then this file IS that datastore, it will be difficult to source control the constant changes to this file.

:::note
There is a file `/App_Data/packages/installedPackages.config` that lists all packages installed via the Umbraco backoffice, depending on how you update or install packages to your site, it can be useful to track changes to this file in source control.

#### Umbraco Models Builder

The strategy here will depend a little on which mode ['Umbraco Models Builder'](../../../Reference/Templating/Modelsbuilder) you have opted to work with.

- **Pure Live** (default), The models are generated in memory, no source control required.
- **App_Data**, The models are generated in the `/App_Data` folder of your project (or can be configured to be in a different folder or project), allowing you to track changes to the models in source/version control.
- **Dll**, The models are generated into a class library dll, avoid adding the dll to source control, to avoid tricky merge conflicts!

There is a custom Visual Studio Extension: [Umbraco ModelsBuilder Custom Tool](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ZpqrtBnk.UmbracoModelsBuilderCustomTool) that you can install (along with the *Umbraco.ModelsBuilder.Api* NuGet package) to help generate models from within Visual Studio.

#### Media

The Media section of Umbraco (unless configured otherwise) stores files in the `/Media` folder, these can be updated by editors, in the Umbraco backoffice, so generally speaking you would not source control these files.

#### Packages and Plugins

The **App_Plugins** folder is the home for all third party packages installed on your site.

Depending on how you installed the plugin it will affect how you choose to version control a particular third party plugin:

- **NuGet** - if the plugin is installed via NuGet then as long as the packages.config file in the root of your project is source controlled, then the installed files for individual plugins shouldn't need to be source controlled (and your deployment process should pull the packages implementation files from NuGet during the build and deployment process).
- **Backoffice** - if your working with other developers, then it may be easier to add the plugin files to source control, or at least communicate to them that the particular package needs be installed via the backoffice.
- **Backoffice + Buildserver** - you'll need to include the plugin files in source control as the build server won't know to restore them - if the plugin/package doesn't come with a NuGet resource, consider setting up your own local NuGet repository for your build server to pull the files from.

:::note
Each plugin could be different depending on its implementation and functionality. It may contain files that it would be useful to track via Source control, and also files that should be ignored: check with the plugin's supporting website/developer for more information.

### What folders and files should I **include** in my source control repository?

#### Front-end build

A lot depends on how you maintain the front-end build of your website, eg are you using css preprocessors such as SCSS/LESS etc - gulp/grunt tasks to combine and minify script resources.
But generally you will need to source control all of your website's static assets: JavaScript, Css, Fonts, Page Furniture Images etc.

#### Views/Templates/Partials

Umbraco site templates/views can be edited via the Umbraco Backoffice. They also reside in the `/Views` folder on disk (or `/masterpages` on webforms implementations). As these views/template often include code, it can make a lot of sense to have their changes tracked under source/version control.

However this can pose a problem if the templates are updated via the backoffice outside of source control on the production environment.
This is not an adviced approach since more often than not this will cause breaking changes to your website.
You would need to manually merge these files before considering a deploy.
Umbraco Cloud is a good solution in these scenarios, as changes via the backoffice are tracked in a Git repository automatically.

#### Macros

Macros can be implemented in four different ways - to source/version control changes to Macro implementation code, track the files in the following locations:

- **Partial View Macros** - stored in `/Views/MacroPartials` as .cshtml files
- **Dynamic Razor** - stored in /macroScripts as .cshtml files (obsolete - use Partial View Macros)
- **UserControls** - stored in /userControls folder as .ascx and ascx.cs files
- **XSLT** - stored in /xslt folder as .xslt files

#### Controllers/Classes/Custom Code

Any supporting custom code for your application should be in version control, eg any
- C# implementation,
  - Surface Controllers,
  - RenderMVCControllers,
  - ViewModels,
  - Helpers / Extension Methods,
  - Services etc
- Supporting class library projects,
- App_Code,
- Models generated by Modelsbuilder in API or App_Data mode

...all should be added to source/version control.

#### Config

Your site's `/config` folder contains the set of configuration files for your Umbraco site. Add these to source control along with config.transforms to change variables for different environments during deployment.

#### DocumentType - Backoffice Structure Changes

When you create and edit eg. Document Types, Media Types and Data Types in the Umbraco Backoffice these values are stored in the Umbraco Database, making them very difficult to source control in a 'file based' version control system.

There are several add-on packages that can help add source control to these structure changes:

- *[The uSync package (free)](https://our.umbraco.com/projects/developer-tools/usync/)* - which can be configured to serialize these changes to files on disk, in a folder called /uSync - enabling you to source/version control these changes and synchronise them to other environments.

- *[uSync Snapshots (licensed)](https://our.umbraco.com/packages/developer-tools/usyncsnapshots/)* - an extension to uSync, for taking 'before' and 'after' snapshots of an Umbraco site, for managing a release of a 'set of changes' between environments.

- *Umbraco Deploy* - package used by Umbraco Cloud, as a replacement for Courier. Cloud-only at this moment, but on-premises is on the [roadmap](https://umbraco.com/products/roadmap/).

## Git

If you are working with Git, you can add a gitignore file to specify intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

### Example gitignore

GitHub has a repository of gitignore files which are a great starting point for working with Umbraco and source control.

Combining: [VisualStudio.gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/VisualStudio.gitignore) & [Umbraco.gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Umbraco.gitignore)
