*For more information check the first 2 steps of [Install Umbraco with .NET CLI](install-umbraco-with-templates.md#Install-the-template)*

:::note  
Check that your Visual Studio version is at least 16.8 (`Help` > `About Microsoft Visual Studio`), lower versions do not install the correct NuGet dependencies.

### Configure project

In this step, you will be able to give your project and solution a name.

:::note  
Refrain from naming your solution `Umbraco`, as this will cause a namespace conflict with the CMS itself.

### Additional information

On the next step, you are able to specify some additional parameters like *Target framework*. The rest are optional.
