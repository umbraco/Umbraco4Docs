# Breaking changes

Below it is possible to read about the breaking changes between Umbraco 9 and 10.
The article is subject to change, the closer we get to the launch of Umbraco 10.

## Update 'diff' from 3.5.0 to 5.0.0

`diff `library used in the Backoffice client is outdated by two major versions. Updating this will be a breaking change since the exposed global object has been renamed from `JsDiff `to `Diff`.

## V10/feature/content schedule performance

Removes mutable ContentSchedule property from `IContent/Content` to `read/write` content schedules. Use _IContentService.GetContentScheduleByContentId && IContentService.PersistContentSchedule_ or the optional _contentSchedule parameter_ on _IContentService.Save_ instead.

## v10 misc - Removed some redundant event handling code

- Removed public methods: _PublishedSnapshotServiceEventHandler.Dispose_, _PublishedSnapshotServiceEventHandler.Dispose(bool)_, and _.PublishedSnapshotServiceEventHandler.Initialize_.
- Removed public ctor.

## v10 scope provider cleanup

- Some public classes in the _Cms.Core.Services_ namespace has moved assembly from **_Umbraco.Cms.Infrastructure_** to **_Umbraco.Cms.Core_**.

- These same public classes have changed namespace from **_Umbraco.Cms.Core.Services.Implement_** to **_Umbraco.Cms.Core.Services_**.

## v10 update to npoco5

NPoco types and interfaces are part of our public interface and there are changes upstream.

## v10 SQLite support + distributed locking abstractions

- Removed support for Microsoft SQL Server Compact (SQL CE).

- Removed `ReadLock` and `WriteLock` methods from _ISqlSyntaxProvider_ interface. Use  _IDistributedLockingMechanism_ (or IScope which delegates to _IDistributedLockingMechanism_) instead.

- Constants for SQL Server provider name moved+consolidated from _Core.Constants.DatabaseProviders_ and _Core.Constants.-DbProviderNames_ to _Umbraco.Cms.Persistence.SqlServer.Constants_

- Various SQL Server related services moved from the `Umbraco.Infrastructure` project to the new `Umbraco.Cms.Persistence` - SqlServer project with altered namespaces e.g.
Persistence.- SqlServer project with altered namespaces e.g.

- _SqlServerSyntaxProvider_, _SqlServerBulkSqlInsertProvider_, _SqlServerDatabaseCreator_

**Added the following methods/properties to ISqlSyntaxProvider. These must be implemented in any downstream implementation e.g:**

- _ISqlSyntaxProvider.HandleCreateTable(IDatabase,TableDefinition,Boolean)_
- _ISqlSyntaxProvider.GetFieldNameForUpdate()_
- _ISqlSyntaxProvider.GetColumn(DatabaseType,String,String,String,String,Boolean)_
- _ISqlSyntaxProvider.InsertForUpdateHint(Sql)_
- _ISqlSyntaxProvider.AppendForUpdateHint(Sql)_
- _ISqlSyntaxProvider.LeftJoinWithNestedJoin(Sql,Func<Sql,Sql>,String)_

## v10: Update to ImageSharp v2

**Update dependency versions**:

- _SixLabors.ImageSharp from 1.0.4 to 2.1.1_

- _SixLabors.ImageSharp.Web from 1.0.5 to 2.0.0_

Renamed `CachedNameLength` property to `CacheHashLength` on **ImagingCacheSettings**.

Moved **ImageSharpImageUrlGenerator** from project `Umbraco.Infrastructure` to `Umbraco.Web.Common` and updated the corresponding namespace and DI registration (from `AddCoreInitialServices()` to `AddUmbracoImageSharp()`);

Moved **ImageSharp** configuration from the _AddUmbracoImageSharp()_ extension method into separate _IConfigureOptions<>_ implementations:

- _The middleware is configured in ConfigureImageSharpMiddlewareOptions (which also replaces ImageSharpConfigurationOptions that previously only set the default ImageSharp configuration);_

- _The default physical cache is configured in ConfigurePhysicalFileSystemCacheOptions._

## V10: Migrate member properties to columns on the member table

This is breaking because it is no longer possible to access the properties listed below through the _IMember.Properties_ collection. You must now access them through their specific properties i.e. _IMember.IsLockedOut_.

- _umbracoMemberFailedPasswordAttempts_
- _umbracoMemberApproved_
- _umbracoMemberLockedOut_
- _umbracoMemberLastLockoutDate_
- _umbracoMemberLastLogin_
- _umbracoMemberLastPasswordChangeDate_

Additionally, when previously you resolved a member as published content, all the default properties would be there twice, for instance, _IsLockedOut_ would be there both as a property with the alias _umbracoMemberLockedOut_ and with the alias _IsLockedOut_, now it'll only be there once, with the alias being the name of the property, so _IsLockedOut_ in this instance.

Lastly the nullable dates on a user, i.e. _LastLoginLate_ will now be null instead of _DateTime.MinValue_ when getting a user with the user service.

## Update examine to version 3

**Examine 3 breaking changes:**

- _ValueSet immutable._
- _ValueSetValidationResult is renamed to ValueSetValidationStatus and ValueSetValidationResult is now a type._

## v10: Async support for content finders.

```CSharp
bool TryFindContent(IPublishedRequestBuilder request);
```

Has changed to:

```CSharp
Task<bool> TryFindContent(IPublishedRequestBuilder request);
```

## v10: Improve redirect content finder scalability

- Added more methods to **_IRedirectUrlRepository_** and **_IRedirectUrlService.cs_**

## v10: Fix Block List settings exception and optimize PVCs

- Added a new method on _IPublishedModelFactory: Type GetModelType(string? alias);_
- The generic types of a _BlockListItem<TContent, TSettings>_ instance in the _BlockListModel_ returned by _BlockListPropertyValueConverter_ is now determined by calling this new method, which can be different and cause a _ModelBindingException_ in your views.

## v10: Async tree search

```CSharp
IEnumerable<SearchResultEntity?> Search(string query, int pageSize, long pageIndex, out long totalFound, string? searchFrom 
= null)
```

Has changed to:

```CSharp
Task<EntitySearchResults> SearchAsync(string query, int pageSize, long pageIndex, string? searchFrom = null);
```

## Moved StackQueue to correct namespace

StackQueue has been moved from **_Umbraco.Core.Collections_** to the **_Umbraco.Cms.Core.Collections_** namespace.

## v10: Global setting SqlWriteLockTimeOut has been removed

This setting has been superseeded by `DistributedLockingWriteLockDefaultTimeout`
