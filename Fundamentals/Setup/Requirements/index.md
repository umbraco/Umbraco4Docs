* IIS 10 and higher
* SQL Server 2019 and higher
* .NET 6.0.5+
* Ability to set file permissions to include create/read/write (or better) for the user that "owns" the Application Pool for your site (NETWORK SERVICE, typically)

You can use Umbraco Cloud to manage the hosting infrastructure. All Umbraco Cloud plans are hosted on Microsoft Azure, which gives your site a proven and solid foundation.

### Miminium requirements to run Umbraco

Umbraco can run on an environment with the minimum requirements stated below:

* Windows Server 2012 R2 and higher
* IIS 8.5 and higher

* .NET 6.0.5+
* Ability to set file permissions to include create/read/write (or better) for the user that "owns" the Application Pool for your site (NETWORK SERVICE, typically)

*For more information, see the [Host and deploy ASP.NET Core applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/?view=aspnetcore-6.0) article in the Microsoft documentation.*

## Database Account Roles

The database account used in the connection string will need permissions to read and write from tables as well as create schema during installs and upgrades:

* The `db_owner` role has full permissions on the database.

* To use an account with more restricted permissions, the `db_datareader` and `db_datawriter` roles will be needed for normal use to read from and write to the database. The `db_ddladmin` role, which can modify the database schema, is required for installs and upgrades of the CMS and/or any packages that create database tables.

For more information on the Database-level roles, see the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/database-level-roles?view=sql-server-ver16#fixed-database-roles).
