## Database Account Roles

The database account used in the connection string will need permissions to read and write from tables. It will also require permission to create schema during installs and upgrades:

* The `db_owner` role has full permissions on the database.

* To use an account with more restricted permissions, the `db_datareader` and `db_datawriter` roles will be needed for normal use to read from and write to the database. The `db_ddladmin` role, which can modify the database schema, is required for installs and upgrades of the CMS and/or any packages that create database tables.

For more information on the Database-level roles, see the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/database-level-roles?view=sql-server-ver16#fixed-database-roles).
