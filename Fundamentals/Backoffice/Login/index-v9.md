# Login screen

To access the backoffice, you will need to login. You can do this by adding `/umbraco` at the end of your website URL, e.g. http://mywebsite.com/umbraco.

You will be presented with a login form similar to this:

![Login screen](images/backoffice-login.png "The login screen has a greeting, username/password field and optionally a 'Forgotten password' link.")

The **login** screen contains a **Greeting**, **Email**, **Password** field and optionally a **Forgotten password** link

Below, you will find instructions on how to customise the login screen.

## Greeting

The login screen features a greeting, which you can personalize by changing the language file of your choice. For example for en-US you would add the following keys to: `~/umbraco/config/lang/en_us.xml`

```xml
<area alias="login">
    <key alias="greeting0">Happy super Sunday</key>
    <key alias="greeting1">Happy manic Monday </key>
    <key alias="greeting2">Happy tubular Tuesday</key>
    <key alias="greeting3">Happy wonderful Wednesday</key>
    <key alias="greeting4">Happy thunderous Thursday</key>
    <key alias="greeting5">Happy funky Friday</key>
    <key alias="greeting6">Happy Caturday</key>
</area>
```

You can customize other text in the login screen as well, grab the default values from `~/umbraco/config/lang/en.xml` and copy the keys you want to translate into your `~/umbraco/config/lang/MYLANGUAGE.xml` file.

## Password reset

The **Forgotten password?** link allows your backoffice users to reset their password. To use this feature, you will need to add the following key to the `Umbraco.Cms.Security` section in the `appsettings.json` file:

```json
"Umbraco": {
    "CMS": {
      "Security": { 
        "AllowPasswordReset": true
      }
   }
}
```

Set it to `true` to enable the password reset feature, and `false` to disable the feature.

You will also need to configure an SMTP server in your `appsettings.json` file. When you get a successful result on the SMTP configuration when running a health check in the backoffice, you are good to go!

An example:

```json
"Umbraco": {
    "CMS": {
      "Global": {
        "Id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "Smtp": {
          "From": "noreply@test.com",
          "Host": "127.0.0.1",
          "Username": "username",
          "Password": "password"
        }
      }
    }
}
```

## Background image

It is possible to customize the background image for the backoffice login screen by adding the `"Content"` section in the `appsettings.json` file:

```json
"Umbraco": {
    "CMS": {
      "Content": {
        "LoginBackgroundImage": "assets/img/login.jpg"
      }
   }
} 
```
