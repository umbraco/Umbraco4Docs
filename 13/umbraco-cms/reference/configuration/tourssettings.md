# Tours settings

The tours section contains the `"EnableTours"` value which allows you to enable or disable tours. By default tours are enabled. If you wish to disable tours set the `"EnableTours"` to false, like so:

```json
"Umbraco": {
  "CMS": {
    "Tours": {
      "EnableTours": false
    }
  }
}
```
