# Umbraco UI Builder vs UI-O-Matic

You might know the open source backoffice UI builder, UI-O-Matic, and wondering why you should choose Umbraco UI Builder instead. To help with that decision, we've put together the following feature matrix to compare some of their major differences.

## API

| Feature | Umbraco UI Builder | UI-O-Matic|
| -- | -- | -- |
| Style | Fluent API | Attribute based API |
| Strongly Typed | Yes | No |
| Seperation of Concerns | Yes - Config is seperate to poco models | No - Config is combined with the poco models |
| Manage 3rd Party Models | Yes - As config is seperate to poco models, Umbraco UI Builder can manage any poco models | No - As config is attribute based, you need to have full control of poco models to add attributes to |
| Configuration Context | Config is always in the context of the poco model with Umbraco UI Builder automatically converting between properties and DB columns | Config switches between poco model properties and DB columns so can be confusing if you aren't aware of the context |
| Supports Dependency Injection | Yes - Where types are passed to the API, the service provider is used to resolve those types allowing for dependency injection of depdendencies | No |
