All Umbraco Heartcore projects include a Content Delivery Network (CDN) using CloudFlare. This CDN is used for caching content and media fetched through the Content Delivery API. Additionally, the media CDN (media.umbraco.io) allows for resizing and cropping options, which improves both performance and stability.
