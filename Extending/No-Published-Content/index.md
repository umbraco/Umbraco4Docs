# No Published Content Page

When Umbraco is first installed, if no starter kit is chosen, there will be no content created in the backoffice, and no published content to display.

Content can also be created, but be unpublished.

If browsing the front-end of the website, when this situation of no published content is found, a custom page is displayed.

This page is served from `/config/splashes/noNodes.aspx`.
