# Health check: Click-Jacking Protection

_Checks if your site is allowed to be IFRAMEd by another site and thus would be susceptible to click-jacking._

## How to fix this health check

This health check can be fixed by adding a header before the response is started.

Preferable you use a security library like [NWebSec](https://docs.nwebsec.com/).

### Adding Click-Jacking Protection using NWebSec

If you take a NuGet dependency on [NWebsec.AspNetCore.Middleware/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NWebsec.AspNetCore.Middleware/), you can use third extension methods on `IApplicationBuilder`.

```cs
public class Startup
{
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        app.UseXfo(options => options.Deny());

        ...
    }
}
```

### Adding Click-Jacking Protection using manual middleware

If you don't like to have a dependency on a third party library, you can add the following custom middleware to the request pipeline instead.

```cs
public class Startup
{
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
    {
        app.Use(async (context, next) =>
        {
            context.Response.Headers.Add("X-Frame-Options", "DENY");
            await next();
        });

       ...
    }
}
```
