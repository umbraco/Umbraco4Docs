# Sections & Trees

The Umbraco backoffice consists of sections (sometimes referred to as applications) which contain Trees.

Each section is identified by an icon in the top navigation ribbon of the Umbraco Backoffice.

For example, when you load the backoffice you'll see that the 'Content' section contains one tree: the content tree whereas the 'Settings' section contains a number of trees: Stylesheets, Content Types, Media Types, etc...

You can create your own sections and trees to extend Umbraco.
