# Uploading to Our

This document shows you how to upload your package to Our and share it with the world.

To get started you first need to have an account on Our. Don't have an account? Head on over to the site and [register](https://our.umbraco.com/member/Signup).

:::note
Our uses a karma system where you get positive karma for answering forum posts, etc. To limit spam you will need to earn a little bit of karma before you can upload a package. Otherwise you can reach out to the [Umbraco support team](https://umbraco.com/contact-us/), who can help you out.
:::

### Creating your package

Before you can upload your package, you first have to create your package. Read over the [Creating a Package](../Creating-a-Package/) article.

### Uploading the package to Our

To get started head over to your [profile page](https://our.umbraco.com/member/profile/). It will tell you on this page if you have enough karma to upload your package, if you do then click `Add Package`.

![Your packages profile page](images/PackagesPage.png)

You may notice if you followed the [Creating a Package](../Creating-a-Package/) document that a lot of this information has already been entered. This isn't automatically pulled from the package file and will need to be entered again.

The form will save each page as you go and the package won't become live until you finish the process and mark it live on the final page. This means you can come back and finish your package submission at any time.
