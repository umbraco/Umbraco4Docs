# Language file for packages

**Applies to version 7.3.0 and newer**

While the Umbraco Core ships with its own set of language files, package authors who would like their UI to be multi-lingual, will need to include their own set of language files as part of their package distribution.

## Including new language keys

For each language your package supports, you include an .xml file in the same format as the core language files, named with its language code. The language files must be located in a `lang` folder inside your package folder in `app_plugins`. If your package assets are in `/app_plugins/mypackage` all language files must be placed in the following locations:

- English keys: `/app_plugins/mypackage/lang/en-US.xml`
- Danish keys: `/app_plugins/mypackage/lang/da-DK.xml`

## Language file format

Each language file can include one or more area, each area contains a collection of language keys with the translation.

For reference on the language file format see the core [language files on GitHub](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/tree/v7/dev/src/Umbraco.Web.UI/umbraco/config/lang)

### Sample structure:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="yes"?>
<language alias="da" intName="Danish" localName="dansk" lcid="6" culture="da-DK">
    <creator>
        <name>The Umbraco community</name>
        <link>http://mydomain.com</link>
    </creator>
    <area alias="dialog">
        <key alias="myKey">Min nøgle</key>
        <key alias="otherKey">Min anden nøgle</key>
    </area>
</language>
```
