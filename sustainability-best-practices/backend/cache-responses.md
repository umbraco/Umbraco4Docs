# Cache responses

Caching in backend development plays a pivotal role in sustainable system design. By storing frequently accessed data in a cache, the system can respond to user requests more swiftly. This means reducing the need for repeated processing and resource-intensive database queries.

This efficiency optimization aligns with the principles of sustainable design by decreasing the strain on hardware and minimizing energy consumption. With cached data readily available, the system can reduce its reliance on constant data retrieval, resulting in shorter response times and improved user experiences.

By mitigating unnecessary resource usage and enhancing overall system responsiveness, caching contributes to a more sustainable software ecosystem. The result will be software ecosystem that operates efficiently and conserves resources, while still delivering high-quality user experiences.

With Umbraco's Delivery API it is possible to use output caching to increase a website's performance. You can read more about this in the [Output caching](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/v/13.latest-rc/reference/content-delivery-api/output-caching) article.
