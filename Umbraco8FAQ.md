In this article you can find answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about Umbraco 8.

If you cannot find the answers you're looking for, reach out to contact@umbraco.com and our Support Warriors will help you out!

## Can I take a trial of Umbraco 8 on Umbraco Cloud?

Yes, you can! All free Umbraco Cloud trials will be on Umbraco 8 from the official release date.

## Can I still create Umbraco 7 projects on Umbraco Cloud and for how long?

You will be able to create Umbraco 7 project on Umbraco Cloud up until July 2021.

When creating a new paid Umbraco Cloud project, youâ€™ll get the option to choose which major version of Umbraco to use.

From July 2021 you can no longer create new sites nor create baseline children based on Umbraco 7.

## For how long will Umbraco 7 projects be supported on Umbraco Cloud?

We will continue to support Umbraco 7 projects on Umbraco Cloud until September 30th 2023. Support means providing you with necessary updates in regards to security fixes.

From August 2023 Umbraco 7 will be considered End of Life (EOL), and we will therefor recommend that you make sure to migrate your project to a newer before then. 

Learn more about the Support and Security phases as well as get all the dates related to the life-cycle of Umbraco 7 in the [Support, LTS and EOL blog post](https://umbraco.com/blog/announcement-support-lts-and-eol-for-umbraco-cms-cloud-and-packages/).

## Will it be possible to upgrade automatically from Umbraco 7 to Umbraco 8?

There is no direct upgrade path from Umbraco 7 to Umbraco 8, but it is be possible to migrate content from Umbraco 7 sites to Umbraco 8 sites. We have added content migrations in Umbraco 8.1.0 that will enable you to move your content (content/media/members) from an Umbraco 7 site to an Umbraco 8 site.

The reason why it is not possible to upgrade an Umbraco 7 site to Umbraco 8 is that the codebase has been fundamentally updated in Umbraco 8. A lot of outdated code and technology has been removed and instead new, faster and more secure technology has been implemented throughout Umbraco 8.

### Migrating content from Umbraco 7 to Umbraco 8

If you have an Umbraco 7 site you can migrate the content to an Umbraco 8.1+ site. Read how to do it in our [Content Migration guide](Getting-Started/Setup/Upgrading/migrating-to-v8).

:::tip
If you are using Umbraco Cloud we have a [Cloud specific migration guide](Umbraco-Cloud/Upgrades/Migrating-from-7-to-8) that will take you through the Cloud specific considerations.

## For how long will Umbraco 7 be supported outside of Umbraco Cloud?

As Umbraco 7 is open source, you'll be able to use it, well, forever. You should though be aware that Umbraco HQ is only committed to supporting this version up until a specific date.

New features will not be added to Umbraco 7 going forward, and the last planned minor release for Umbraco 7 was Umbraco 7.15.0 which was released on July 9th 2019.

Umbraco 7.15 will be supported till the end of June 2021, after which it will enter the Security phase. In this phase only security issues will be fixed. 

By the end of September 2023 Umbraco 7 will be considered End Of Life (EOL), and we will no longer recommend using it.

We will continue to provide necessary updates in regard to bug and security fixes for Umbraco 7 up until the September 2023.

The introduction of three new features: Infinite Editing, Content Apps and Language Variants. All features that have been added to make working with Umbraco more enjoyable for everyone involved.

Also, if you are a developer and currently have projects on Umbraco 7 (or previous versions) you will notice a big difference in the codebase. In Umbraco 8 we have added improvements and updated dependencies as well as done a thorough clean-up to make it simpler for you to work with and extend your Umbraco project.
