## Can I take a trial of Umbraco 8 on Umbraco Cloud?

Yes, you can! All free Umbraco Cloud trials will be on Umbraco 8 from the official release date.

## Can I still create Umbraco 7 projects on Umbraco Cloud and for how long?

Yes, until the end of 2019 you are still able to create Umbraco 7 Projects on Umbraco Cloud.

When creating a new paid Umbraco Cloud project, youâ€™ll get the option to create it in either Umbraco 7 or Umbraco 8.

If you're running an Umbraco Cloud Baseline project on Umbraco 7 you are able to create new Umbraco 7 child projects up until February 28th 2021.

## For how long will Umbraco 7 projects be supported on Umbraco Cloud?

We will continue to support Umbraco 7 project on Umbraco Cloud until September 30th 2023. Support means providing you with necessary updates in regard to bug and security fixes. Following September 30th 2023, Umbraco 7 project will no longer work on Umbraco Cloud, so we'll therefore recommend you make sure you migrate your projects to Umbraco 8 before this date.

## Will it be possible to upgrade automatically from Umbraco 7 to Umbraco 8?

There is no direct upgrade path from Umbraco 7 to Umbraco 8, but it is be possible to migrate content from Umbraco 7 sites to Umbraco 8 sites. We have added content migrations in Umbraco 8.1.0 that will enable you to move your content (content/media/members) from an Umbraco 7 site to an Umbraco 8 site.

The reason why it is not possible to upgrade an Umbraco 7 site to Umbraco 8 is that the codebase has been fundamentally updated in Umbraco 8. A lot of outdated code and technology has been removed and instead new, faster and more secure technology has been implemented throughout Umbraco 8.

### Migrating content from Umbraco 7 to Umbraco 8

If you have an Umbraco 7 site you can migrate the content to an Umbraco 8.1+ site. Read how to do it in our [Content Migration guide](Getting-Started/Setup/Upgrading/migrating-to-v8).

:::tip
If you are using Umbraco Cloud we have a [Cloud specific migration guide](Umbraco-Cloud/Upgrades/Migrating-from-7-to-8) that will take you through the Cloud specific considerations.

## For how long will Umbraco 7 be supported outside of Umbraco Cloud?
As Umbraco 7 is open source, you'll be able to use it, well, forever. You should though be aware that Umbraco HQ is only committed to supporting this version up until a specific date.

We will continue to provide necessary updates in regard to bug and security fixes for Umbraco 7 up until the September 30th 2023.

New features will not be added to Umbraco 7 going forward, and the last planned minor release for Umbraco 7 was Umbraco 7.15.0 which was released on July 9th 2019.

If you are an Umbraco Gold Partner or have a support plan with Umbraco HQ, we will continue to provide technical support for Umbraco 7 projects until February 28th 2021.

## What are the highlights of Umbraco 8?

The introduction of three new features: Infinite Editing, Content Apps and Language Variants. All features that have been added to make working with Umbraco even simpler, smoother and basically, more enjoyable. For everyone involved!

Also, if you are a developer and currently have projects on Umbraco 7 (or previous versions) you will notice a big difference in the codebase. In Umbraco 8 we have added improvements and updated dependencies as well as done a thorough clean-up to make it simpler for you to work with and extend your Umbraco project.
