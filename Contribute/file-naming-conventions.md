# Multi version documentation conventions

To support multi version documentation we work according to the conventions you can read about in this article.

## File naming

Naming conventions for documentation files.

The current version of a documentation article will be the normal existing filename format e.g. `ContentService-Events.md` or `index.md`

When creating alternate versions of the article that apply in different Umbraco versions, we will append to the filename portion a `-v` followed by information which explains roughly to which version the documentation applies.

### Indicating ranges on file naming

Documentation that only applies to a single Umbraco version would be `index-v7.7.7.md`.

For documentation that applies to a range of versions, we will use `vpost` and `vpre` in the filename to indicate this. E.g.:

`index-vpost7.6.md` would contain documentation to be used after version 7.6 but before the next documentation version
and `index-vpre7.3.md` would contain the documentation for versions before version 7.3.

The `vpost` and `vpre` notations are not used to render to the user.

For SEO reasons it is not necessary to change a file name when a feature becomes obsolete.

## Adding meta data

It is the [YAML meta data](adding-metadata.md) in the document itself, that will be used as the "point of truth" for when a version applies from and to.
The YAML will be added to an examine index, along with the filename and is used later on for searching on (major) version, or to show the information to the user.

For versioning we use 3 YAML attributes:

1. `versionFrom` to indicate a start version, including the version you're setting here
2. `versionTo` to indicate which version the support ended - including the version you're setting here
3. `versionRemoved` to indicate in which version the feature described in the article was removed

:::note
If only a `versionFrom` is specified and not a `versionTo` the version will be open ended and apply to all newer versions.

If none of the version tags are specified, the article will default to `versionFrom: 7.0.0` and be open ended.

## Discovering other pages

Alternative pages for documentation will be discovered by searching the examine index for other files beginning with the same name e.g.

If we are on the page

    /Documentation/Getting-Started/Setup/Server-Setup/Load-Balancing/ContentService-Events.md

we will search for any documents in the index beginning with

    /Documentation/Getting-Started/Setup/Server-Setup/Load-Balancing/ContentService-Events

which will return

    /Documentation/Getting-Started/Setup/Server-Setup/Load-Balancing/ContentService-Events-vpre7.3.md

We will use the YAML for these files to display the alternate versions options to the user.

When searching the documentation articles on Our, there is an app setting that indicates the 'current' major Umbraco version, only versions documentation that have no end version specified will be returned for this major version in the initial search. However, we will explain in the search results that the user has searched the current documentation and present an option to further 'search all versions'.

## Examples

On every document the other versions will be linked to. These are some examples on how they will be referenced to:

file name                             | versionFrom  | versionTo | renders out
-------                               |:------------:|     -----:| ---
`index-v7.md`                         | 7.0.0        |           | 7.0.0 +
`index-vpre7.3.md`                   |              | 7.3.0     | pre 7.3.0
`index-vpost7.6.md`                  | 7.6.0        | 7.7.2     | 7.6.0 - 7.7.2
`index-v7.7.7.md`                     | 7.7.7        | 7.7.7     | 7.7.7 (only)
`index.md`                            |              |           | current
