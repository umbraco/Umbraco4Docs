# Markdown conventions

The Umbraco Documentation uses Markdown for all the articles - but more precisely we use the CommonMark specification. Read more about the [difference between CommonMark and Markdown](https://commonmark.org/).

In this article you can learn how to use Markdown, as well as how we structure the files.

## Structure

For the documentation project, each individual topic is contained in its own folder.
Each folder must have an `index.md` file which links to the individual sub-pages, if images are used, these must be in `images` folders next to the .md file referencing them relatively.

* topic
  * images
    * images.jpg
  * Subtopic
    * images
    * index.md
  * index.md
  * other-page.md

## Images

Images are stored and linked relatively to .md pages, and should by convention always be in an `images` folder. So to add an image to `/documentation/reference/partials/renderviewpage.md` you link it like so:

    ![My Image Alt Text](images/img.jpg)

And store the image as `/documentation/reference/partials/images/img.jpg`

Images can have a maximum width of **800px**. Please always try to use the most efficient compression, `gif`, `png` or `jpg`. No `bmp`, `tiff` or `swf` (Flash).

## External links

Include either the complete URL, or link using a specific syntax:

    https://yahoo.com/something

or

    [yahoo something](https://yahoo.com/something)

## Internal links

If you need to link between pages, always link relatively and optionally include the .md extension based on the scenario. For example 
if you need to provide hyperlink to an `index.md` file which is in the current folder then only the path including the folder name is required. If you want provide hyperlink to any file other than `index.md` in the current folder then only the path including the folder name along with the filename is required.The `.md` extension is not required in this case.

or

## Formatting code

Indent your sample with 4 spaces, which will cause it to be rendered as `<pre><code>` tags.
For inline code, wrap in ` (backtick) chars.

Use # for the headline, ## for sub headers and ### for parameters (on code reference pages)

For optional parameters wrap in _ (underscore) - end result: `###_optionalParameter_`

## Adding notes, warnings, tips

The Markdown conversion library used in the documentation is called [Markdig](https://github.com/lunet-io/markdig). It has the possibility of adding classes to markdown that you can then target with CSS. There are a few custom Markdown classes that can be used:

```
:::note
This is a note, it contains useful information and also a link: https://thisisalink.com/useful/resource, please make sure it looks nice on Our!
:::

:::warning
This is a warning, it contains useful information and also a link: https://thisisalink.com/useful/resource, please make sure it looks nice on Our!
:::

:::tip
This is a tip, it contains useful information and also a link: https://thisisalink.com/useful/resource, please make sure it looks nice on Our!
:::

:::checklist
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
- Item 4
::: 
```
Will render like this:

:::
