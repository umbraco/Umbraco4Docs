# Manual upgrade of the Umbraco Cloud engine

This article will give you an overview of how you should upgrade Umbraco Deploy or Umbraco Courier.

Whether your project is running Courier or Deploy is dependent on which version of Umbraco CMS your Umbraco Cloud project is running. Read the [Product Dependencies](../Product-Dependencies) article for more details on this.

## Upgrading Umbraco Deploy

**NOTE**: All new projects on Umbraco Cloud use Umbraco Deploy. The same goes for projects running Umbraco CMS version 7.6 and higher.

Here are the steps you need to follow carefully to manually upgrade Deploy on your Umbraco Cloud project:

1. Download the latest version of Umbraco Deploy here: http://nightly.umbraco.org/?container=umbraco-deploy-release
    * Check [Product Dependencies](../Product-Dependencies) to be sure you download the correct version of Deploy
2. Unzip the file on your computer
3. Copy/Paste the files from the unzipped folder to your local project folder
    * You should **not** overwrite the following files:
    * `Config/UmbracoDeploy.config`
    * `Config/UmbracoDeploy.Settings.config`
4. Run the project locally - make sure it runs without any errors
5. Commit and deploy the changes to the Cloud environment
6. Again, make sure everything runs without errors before deploying to the next Cloud environment

## Upgrading Umbraco Courier

**NOTE**: Only Umbraco Cloud projects running Umbraco CMS version 7.5.14 or lower are using Umbraco Courier.

Here are the steps you need to follow carefully to manually upgrade Courier on your Umbraco Cloud project:

1. Download the latest version of Umbraco Courier here: http://nightly.umbraco.org/?container=umbraco-courier-release
    * Choose the file called Courier.Concorde.UI.vX.Y.Z.zip - where *X.Y.Z* is the version number
2. Unzip the file on your computer
3. Copy/Paste the files from the unzipped folder to your local project folder
    * If you've added custom configuration in the `courier.config` file you may not want to overwrite this file
4. Run your project locally - make sure it runs without errors
5. Commit and deploy the changes to the Cloud environment
6. Again, make sure everything runs without errors before deploying to the next Cloud environment
