Follow the steps 9-12 to update the following packages as well:

|Package                                  |Version         |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------|
|Umbraco.Deploy.Cloud                     |10.0.0          |
|Umbraco.Deploy.Contrib                   |10.0.0          |
|Umbraco.Forms                            |10.0.0          |
|Umbraco.Deploy.Forms                     |10.0.0          |
|Umbraco.Cloud.Identity.Cms               |10.0.2          |
|Umbraco.Cloud.StorageProviders.AzureBlob |10.0.0          |

:::note
If you have more projects in your solution or other packages, make sure that these are also updated to support .NET 6 framework.
:::

With the packages and projects updated, it is time to make some changes to some of the default files.

1. Update the `Program` class in the `Program.cs` file to the following:

    ```CSharp
    using Umbraco.Cms.Web.Common.Hosting;

    public class Program
        {
            public static void Main(string[] args)
                => CreateHostBuilder(args)
                    .Build()
                    .Run();

            public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
                Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                    .ConfigureUmbracoDefaults()
                    .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
                    {
                        webBuilder.UseStaticWebAssets();
                        webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
                    });
        }
    ```

2. Re-enable the appsettings IntelliSense by updating your schema reference in the **appsettings.json** file from:

    ```json
    "$schema": "./umbraco/config/appsettings-schema.json",
    ```

    To:

    ```json
    "$schema": "./appsettings-schema.json",
    ```

    Apply this change to the following files as well:
    * **appsettings.Development.json**
    * **appsettings.Production.json**
    * **appsettings.Staging.json**

3. Remove the following files and folders *manually* from your local project:

    * `/wwwroot/umbraco`
    * `/umbraco/PartialViewMacros`
    * `/umbraco/UmbracoBackOffice`
    * `/umbraco/UmbracoInstall`
    * `/umbraco/UmbracoWebsite`
    * `/umbraco/config/lang`

4. Update the Umbraco Forms related files and folders according to the [Upgrading - version specific](../../../Add-ons/UmbracoForms/Installation/Version-Specific.md) for version 10 article.

5. Choose your Database configuration:
    * To re-use the existing LocalDB database, configure the [ConnectionStrings](https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/Add-ons/Umbraco-Deploy/Upgrades/version-specific#database-initialization) or use the [`PreferLocalDbConnectionString` setting](https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/Add-ons/Umbraco-Deploy/Deploy-Settings/#preferlocaldbconnectionstring).
    * To use the default SQLite database, skip this step.

6. Build and run your project locally to verify the Umbraco 10 upgrade.

    ![Target Framework](images/verify-v10-upgrade-locally.png)

7. Update the `global.json` in root repository folder
:::note
If `global.json` does not exist in the root of your repository, you can read about the `global.json` [Microsoft docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-json)
:::

Upgrade your `global.json` to target the runtime sdk for the latest version of [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

```json
{
  "sdk": {
    "allowPrerelease": false,
    "version": "6.0.402",
    "rollForward": "minor"
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Deploy and Test on Umbraco Cloud

Once the Umbraco 10 project runs locally without any errors, the next step is to deploy and test on the Cloud Development environment.

1. Remove the folders mentioned above on the **Development** environment using [KUDU](../../Set-Up/Power-Tools/index.md) from the `repository` and `wwwroot` folders.
2. Push the changes to the **Development** environment. See the [Deploying from local to your environments](../../Deployment/Local-to-Cloud/index.md) article.
3. Test **everything** in the **Development** environment.

We highly recommend that you go through everything on your Development environment. This can help you identify any potential errors after the upgrade, and ensure that you are not deploying any issues onto your Live environment.

## Step 5: Going live

Before deploying the upgrade to your Live environment, you will need to remove the folders you also removed from both your local instance and your Development environment.

The files are:

* `/wwwroot/umbraco`
* `/umbraco/PartialViewMacros`
* `/umbraco/UmbracoBackOffice`
* `/umbraco/UmbracoInstall`
* `/umbraco/UmbracoWebsite`
* `/umbraco/config/lang`

If using Umbraco Forms, update your files and folders according to the [Upgrading - version specific](../../../Add-ons/UmbracoForms/Installation/Version-Specific.md) for version 10 article.

They need to be removed through KUDU from both the `repository` and `wwwroot` folders.
