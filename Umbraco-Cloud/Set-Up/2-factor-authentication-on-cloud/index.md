## Disabeling 2-factor authentication

You can always disable 2-factor authentication from your profile.

To disable 2-factor authentication for your user, you will need to use the authentication method that you had enabled to disable it again.

If you had phone authentication enabled, it will then need to be used to disable it again.

The same is the case for email authentication.
