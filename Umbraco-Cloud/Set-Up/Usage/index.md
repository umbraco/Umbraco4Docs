On Umbraco Cloud, you can always upgrade your project to a higher plan if you have reached the limit of what you are allowed on your project. You can **Upgrade Plan** from the **Settings** drop-down list on your project.

You can see the prices for the different plans on Umbraco Cloud on our [website](https://umbraco.com/umbraco-cloud-pricing/) or when you are upgrading your plan.

:::warning
If you exceed the limitations of the plan that your project is on, we will automaticly upgrade your project to a higher plan that fits the usage of your project.

When your project has reached 90% of the usage limits for the plan, we will notify the technical contact through the portal as well as we send out an email.
