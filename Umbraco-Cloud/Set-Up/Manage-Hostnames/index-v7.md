# Managing hostnames

When you create an Umbraco Cloud project we create the project URLs based on the name you give your project.

Let's say you have a project named `Snoopy`. These will be the default hostnames:

* Umbraco Cloud Portal: *www.s1.umbraco.io/project/snoopy*
* Live site: *snoopy.s1.umbraco.io*
* Development environment: *dev-snoopy.s1.umbraco.io*
* Staging environment: *stage-snoopy.s1.umbraco.io*

To access the backoffice add `/umbraco` to the end of the Live, Development or Staging URL.

## Domains

Under *Settings* in the Umbraco Cloud Portal, you'll find **Hostnames**. This is where you go when you want to bind hostnames to your Cloud environments.

![Hostnames](images/manage-hostnames.png)

You can bind any hostname to your project environments. Keeping in mind that the hostname will need to have a DNS entry so that it resolves to the Umbraco Cloud service.

Once you add a hostname to one of your environments make sure to update the hostname DNS entry to resolve to the umbraco.io service. We recommend setting a CNAME record for your hostname using **dns.umbraco.io** or an A record using an IP, either `104.19.191.28` or `104.19.208.28`. Check with your DNS host or hostname registrar for details on how to configure this for your hostnames.

:::warning
Adding an A-Record to the static IP is only recommended when setting up a CNAME record is not an option. The static IP is highly volatile towards changes to the Umbraco Cloud infrastructure and as such, it may change.

You will also have to specify the hostname for each root node if you are using a multisite setup.

* Go to the Umbraco Backoffice
* *Right-click* the root content node
* Choose **Culture and Hostnames**
* Add your hostname
* Hit *Save*

Once you've assigned a hostname to your Umbraco Cloud environment, you may want to hide the default umbraco.io URL (e.g. *snoopy.s1.umbraco.io*). We've created a rewrite rule for this purpose - find it in the [Rewrites on Cloud](Rewrites-on-Cloud/#hiding-the-default-umbracoio-url) article.

### Automatic TLS (HTTPS)

All hostnames added to a Umbraco Cloud project's environment will get a TLS (HTTPS) certificate added by default. The certificate is issued by Cloudflare and valid for 1 year after which it will be automatically renewed. Everything around certificates and renewals is handled for you and you only need to make sure that the DNS records are configured according to our recommendations listed above.

:::note
Hostnames added prior to December 8th 2020 will be issued by Let's Encrypt and will continue to be renewed until the hostname is removed or re-added. If a hostname is removed and then re-added the DNS should be configured as mentioned in the section above, and then the certificate will be issued and renewed by Cloudflare (with Digicert as the Certificate Authority).

Find instructions on how to change the certificate for your hostname in the [How to move away from Umbraco Latch](Move-away-from-Latch) article.

Do note that you will need to **remove the old DNS entry** before the Cloudflare service will generate a new certificate for your hostname.

### Is your domain hosted on your own Cloudflare account?

Cloudflare is a popular DNS provider, which offers a variety of different services to improve performance and security. We also use it for DNS and Hostnames on Umbraco Cloud. This means that when your own domain is also hosted with Cloudflare you need to enroll the hostname you want to add to your Umbraco Cloud project in a slightly different way.

When creating a CNAME or A-record for your hostname in Cloudflare you need to start with Proxy Status set to 'DNS Only'. Once your hostname is marked with "Protected" under the Hostname page for your Umbraco Cloud project and you can access your website through the hostname, you can choose to change Proxy Status to 'Proxying'. This is mostly relevant when you need to use specific Cloudflare services like Page Rules, Workers, or the like. If you keep the Proxy Status set to 'DNS Only' Umbraco Cloud will handle the automatic TLS setup to ensure that your hostname is always protected with HTTPS.

### Using Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) for your domain?

CAA is a [DNS resource record type defined in RFC 6844](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6844) that allows a domain owner to indicate which Certificate Authorities (CAs) are allowed to issue certificates for them. If you use CAA records on your domain, you will either need to remove CAA entirely or add the following through your DNS provider:

```
example.com. IN CAA 0 issue "digicert.com"
```

This is necessary because DigiCert is the Certificate Authority for the certificates issued on Umbraco Cloud.

It is possible for CAA records to be set on the subdomain, but it's not something that is commonly used. If there’s a CAA record at, e.g., app.example.com, you’ll need that removed or updated. If you want to use wildcards and allow certificates for any subdomain the CAA record should look like this:

```
example.com. IN CAA 0 issuewild "digicert.com"
```

## [Upload certificates manually](Security-Certificates)

On the Professional and Enterprise plan, you can manually add your own certificate to your Umbraco Cloud project and bind it to one of the hostnames you've added.
