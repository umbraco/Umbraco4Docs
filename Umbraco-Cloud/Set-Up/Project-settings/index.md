# Project settings

When working with an Umbraco Cloud project you can handle a lot of the project configuration directly in the Umbraco Cloud Portal.

The things you can configure include hostnames / domains, SSL certificates, database connections and deployment webhooks.

![settings](images/project-settings.png)

## [Edit team](../Team-Members)

From this page you can manage the team members on your project.

This is also where you need to go, to add a [Technical contact](../Team-Members/Technical-Contact.md) to your project.

## [Connection details](../../Databases)

This is where you go to find connection details to your Umbraco Cloud databases.

You will need to whitelist your IP in order to connect to the databases with your local machine - this can also be done from this page.

## [Hostnames](../Manage-Hostnames)

Binding hostnames to your Umbraco Cloud project is done from the Umbraco Cloud Portal - the page is called **Hostnames**.

## [Certificates](../Manage-Hostnames/Security-Certificates)

All hostnames added to your Umbraco Cloud environments will automatically be assigned a security certificate - we call this feature [Umbraco Latch](../Umbraco-Latch).

Sometimes you might want to upload and bind your own security certificate to your hostnames. This can be  done from the **Certificates** page.

## Public access

All Staging and Development environments on Umbraco Cloud projects are by default protected by *basic authentication* which require you to enter your Cloud credentials in order to view the frontend. You can disable / enable this authentication with one click on the **Public access** page.

:::note
On **Trial** projects the basic authentication is enabled on the Live environment. This cannot be removed before setting up a subscription for the Cloud project.
:::

On the **Public access** page you can also whitelist IPs which will allow for viewing the frontend of the Staging and/or Development environments when accessed from the whitelisted IPs.

## [Webhooks](../../Deployment/Deployment-webhook)

On Umbraco Cloud projects we've made it possible to configure a deployment webhook on your environments. This will be triggered upon successful deployments, you can configure where you would like information about the deployment to be posted.

## Upgrade to Professional

From the *Settings* menu you can upgrade your project to a Professional plan.

The option will not be available when you are already on a Professional plan or if you are running in Trial mode.

## Renaming and deleting

You might need to rename your Umbraco Cloud project - find the option to do that from the *Settings* menu.

:::note
If you are working locally you need to update the origin of your local git repository to point to the new clone url. Alternatively you can make a fresh local clone of the project, once youâ€™ve changed your project name.
:::

If you want to delete your Umbraco Cloud project you can find the option to do this from the *Settings* menu as well. Deleting your Umbraco Cloud project is permanent - all data, media, databases, configuration, setup, and domain bindings are removed in the process.

:::note
Deleting your Umbraco Cloud project will also cancel any subscriptions you have set up for the project.
