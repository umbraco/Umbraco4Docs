# Pushing upgrades to a Child Project
When a project has one or more Child Projects it will appear on the Project page, and the user can click to get an overview of all the Child Projects based on the current project.

From this page you will have an overview af all the Child Projects this Baseline project has. This is also where you go, when you want to push upgrades from your Baseline Project to the Child Projects.

2. Click **Update selected children**
3. Make sure the selection looks correct then click **Confirm**
4. Follow the process as the upgrades are pushed to the child projects one by one
