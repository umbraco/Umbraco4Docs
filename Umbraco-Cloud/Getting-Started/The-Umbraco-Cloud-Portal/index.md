# The Umbraco Cloud Portal

The Umbraco Cloud Portal helps you manage your Umbraco Cloud project. From here, you can view and manage all your Cloud projects in one place.

## Umbraco Cloud Portal Overview

When you log in to the [Umbraco Cloud Portal](https://www.s1.umbraco.io/home/login/), the projects dashboard gives an overview of all your Umbraco Cloud projects. Here, you can view all the projects you've created or have been added to as a team member.

![View all projects](images/Umbraco-cloud-dashboard.png)

You can see the project's environments, usage for each project, which plans it's on, and whether it's a baseline or baseline-child project.

In the top-right corner of the Umbraco Cloud Portal, you will find:

- **Create New Project** - Allows you to create more projects using the plan you wish and a project will be ready for you within a few minutes.

- **Notifications** - You can also see notifications for your different projects. For example: if your project has been automatically updated or if an upgrade has failed.

- **Profile** - Manage projects, subscriptions, pending invites, organization information, profile details, view release notes, and log out of the portal.

## Project Groups

### Settings

In the right-side corner of the Umbraco Cloud Portal, you can enable **Show environments** and **Show usage** of the project from the **Settings** option.

While managing the environments on your project, click on **Manage environments** to add and/or remove environments as needed. Read more about how the number of environments varies depending on the plan you are on, in the [Project overview](../Project-Overview) article.

Aside from these features, it's also from the project view that changes are deployed from one Cloud environment to another. Find out more in the [Cloud-to-Cloud](../../Deployment/Cloud-to-Cloud) article.

## Release Notes

On the Umbraco Cloud portal, you can now find the link to the **Release Notes** in the **Profile** dropdown. Release notes are published every month and list the most relevant fixes and features added to the portal.

## Environment error log

Each environment has an error log that appears only if you have any unread errors in that specific environment. You can view the errors by clicking on **View errors** in the environment menu.

Once you're there, you can manually mark each error as read which will move it from the "New" section to the "Read" section. Errors marked as read will be permanently deleted after 30 days.

During development, you can happen to gather a large number of errors which might cause the error page to load slowly. A fix for that would be to locally connect to the database for that specific environment and delete the errors. You can read more about connecting to the environment database locally in the section about [Database on Umbraco Cloud](../../Databases/Cloud-Database).

Environment errors are stored in the `UCErrorLog` table.

The query below will delete 90% of the errors. The query will always delete the oldest errors first. You can tweak the query to delete any percentage of errors by changing the number in the first row.

```sql
DELETE TOP(90) PERCENT
  FROM [dbo].[UCErrorLog]
  WHERE [Read] = 0
```
