# Umbraco Cloud

In this article, you can read about [Umbraco Cloud](https://umbraco.com/products/umbraco-cloud/) and how to get started.

## Umbraco Cloud Overview

Umbraco Cloud is a great way to work with your favorite CMS. Built on the Microsoft Azure Cloud and encompassing web standard approaches, Umbraco Cloud is familiar to Umbraco's new and old users. With Umbraco Cloud, there are no limits to what you can accomplish - anything you can do with Umbraco and web technology you can do with Umbraco Cloud.

Umbraco Cloud takes care of installation, infrastructure, and security. Umbraco also provides you the tools to work with your project in the Cloud or locally by cloning the project down to your PC or Mac.

When you are ready to show your work to the world, Umbraco Cloud provides a safe deployment mechanism that lets you publish to the web. When you have changes or updates to your site, Umbraco Cloud follows the process of moving, testing, and deploying your changes to your public site.

With all the success you will have to build your site with Umbraco Cloud, you will want to add more using the same account and team members all from a single place. [Learn more and sign up for Umbraco Cloud](https://umbraco.com/campaigns/try-umbraco-today/).

## Umbraco Cloud Project

### Trial Project

The easiest way to get started with an Umbraco Cloud project is to take a [14-day free trial](https://umbraco.com/?product_tour_id=103162). The project is automatically created and you are ready to get started within a few minutes.

Since we set up the entire project, we recommend that you get to know your project before you start building.

To start working with and building your site, you can either work directly in the backoffice on the Cloud environment or you can [clone down the project to your local machine](../Set-Up/Working-Locally). For Mac users, see [Working with Mac](../Set-Up/Working-With-UaaS-Cli).

## Different ways to start an Umbraco Cloud project

You might not always want to start your Umbraco Cloud project with a clean slate. Perhaps you have an already existing site that you want to move on to the Cloud. For this purpose, we've created a [Migration guide](Migrate-Existing-Site) that you can follow to successfully move your project to Umbraco Cloud.

If you are creating several similar projects, we have a feature called [Baselines](Baselines) that lets you create new projects based on existing Umbraco Cloud projects.
