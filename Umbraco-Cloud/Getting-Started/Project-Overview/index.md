# Umbraco Cloud Project Overview

Umbraco Cloud Projects are made of three major components: Environments, Team Members/Invite Users, and a Settings section.

## Environments

The number of *Environments* in your project is dependent on which plan you are on:

* With the **Starter Plan**, you have the option to add a *Development* environment.

* With the **Standard Plan**, you get a *Development* and a *Live* environment with the option to add a *Staging* environment. You can add/remove environments as needed

* With the **Professional Plan**, you get a *Development*, a *Staging*, and a *Live* environment - as with the Standard Plan you can add/remove environments as needed.

* With the **Enterprise Plan**, you get a *Development*, a *Staging*, and a *Live* environment - as with the Professional Plan you can add/remove environments as needed.

To get a technical overview of your Cloud environments, see the [Environments](../Environments) article. For more information on how to add or remove environments, see the [Manage Environments](../../Set-Up/Manage-Environments) article.

## Team Members/Invite Users

Another major component of your Umbraco Cloud project is *Team Members*. When you add team members to a project, they will automatically be added as backoffice users in all the environments. Team members can be added as *Admins*, *Writers*, or *Readers*. Refer to the [Team Members](../../Set-Up/Team-Members) article to learn more about these roles.

## Settings

In the *Settings* section, you can manage and configure your project to fit your needs. Learn more about the different settings in the [Project Settings](../../Set-Up/Project-settings) article.
