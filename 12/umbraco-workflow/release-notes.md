### [12.1.0](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Workflow.Issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Arelease%2F12.1.0) (September 5th 2023)

* BREAKING CHANGE: `ContentReviewReminderEmailer.SendReviewReminders.reviews` parameter changes from `Dictionary<UserGroupPoco, List<ContentReviewConfigPoco>>` to `Dictionary<IWorkflowGroup, List<ContentReviewConfigPoco>>`, which in turn changes the type of the `SentEntities` property in `WorkflowContentReviewsEmailNotificationsSendingNotification` and `WorkflowContentReviewsEmailNotificationsSentNotification`. `UserGroupPoco` implements `IWorkflowGroup`, but contains properties not present on the interface. These can be accessed by casting to the implemented type.
