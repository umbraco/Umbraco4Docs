## Getting the service

### Dependency Injection

If you wish to use the member service in a class, you need to specify the `IMemberService` interface in your constructor:

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    private IMemberService _memberService;
    
    public MyClass(IMemberService memberService)
    {
        _memberService = memberService;
    }
}
```

In Razor views, you can access the member service through the `@inject` directive:

```csharp
@inject IMemberService MemberService
```
