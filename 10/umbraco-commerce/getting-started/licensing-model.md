# Licensing

Umbraco Commerce is a commercial product. You can run an Umbraco Commerce unrestricted locally without the need a license. Running Umbraco Commerce on a public domain will display a warning banner in the backoffice and will limit the maximum number of orders (20). To remove these restrictions, you'll need to have a **valid license**.

## How does it work?

Licenses are sold per backoffice domain and will also work on all subdomains. If you have alternative staging/qa environment domains, additional domains can be added to the license on request.

The licenses are not bound to a specific product version. They will work for all versions of the related product.
{% endhint %}

Let's say that you have a license configured for your domain, `mysite.com`, and you've requested two development domains, `devdomain.com` and `devdomain2.com`.

The license will cover the following domains:

* `localhost`
* `*.local`
* `*.mysite.com`
* `www.mysite.com`
* `devdomain.com`
* `www.devdomain.com`
* `devdomain2.com`
* `www.devdomain2.com`

{% hint style="info" %}
You can have only 1 license per Umbraco installation.
{% endhint %}

## What does a license cover?

There are a few differences as to what the licenses cover:

* A single license covers the installation of Umbraco Commerce in 1 production backoffice domain, as well as in any requested development domains.
* The production domain includes **all subdomains** (e.g. `*.mysite.com`).
* The development domains work with or without the `www` subdomain.
* The license allows for an unlimited number of orders.
* The license also includes `localhost` and `*.local` as a valid domain.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have multiple backoffice domains pointing at the same installation, you have the option to purchase and [add **additional domains**](licensing-model.md#add-additional-domains) to your license.

This is an add-on domain for existing licenses. Refunds will not be given for this product.

## Configuring your license

You can purchase a license via the [Umbraco Commerce](https://umbraco.com/products/umbraco-commerce/) project page. A member of the [SUITS team](mailto:suits@umbraco.com) will manage this process. In the process, you will need to provide all domains you wish to have covered by the license such as primary and staging/qa domains. You should then receive a license code to be installed in your solution.

### Add additional domains

If you require to add addition domains to the license, please reach out to a member of the [SUITS team](mailto:suits@umbraco.com) with your request and they will manage this process.

## Installing your license

Once you have received your license code it needs to be installed on your site.

1. Open the root directory for your project files.
2. Locate and open the `appSettings.json` file.
3. Add your Umbraco Commerce license key to `Umbraco:Licenses:Umbraco.Commerce`:

```json
"Umbraco": {
  "Licenses": {
    "Umbraco.Commerce": "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"
  }
}
```

### Verify the license installation

You can verify that your license is successfully installed by logging into your project's backoffice and navigating to the settings section. Here you will see a licenses dashboard which should display the status of your license.

### When and how to configure an `UmbracoApplicationUrl`

If you are running on a single domain for both your frontend and backend environments, it's not necessary to configure a `UmbracoApplicationUrl`.

If you have different domains for your frontend and backend, then it's advised that you configure an `UmbracoApplicationUrl` set to your backoffice URL. This helps the licensing engine know which URL should be used for validation checks. Without this configuration setting, the licensing engine will try and work out the domain to validate from the HTTP request object. This can lead to errors when switching between domains.


An `UmbracoApplicationUrl` can be configured in your `appSettings.json` file like so:

```json
{
    "Umbraco": {
        "CMS": {
            "WebRouting": {
                "UmbracoApplicationUrl": "https://admin.my-custom-domain.com/"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

See the [Fixed Application URL](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/extending/health-check/guides/fixedapplicationurl) documentation for more details about this setting.

#### Configuring `UmbracoApplicationUrl` on Umbraco Cloud

If you are hosting on Umbraco Cloud you will find the configuration described above won't be reflected in your environment. The reason for this is that Umbraco Cloud sets this value as an environment variable set to the Cloud project domain (`<your project>.umbraco.io`). This overrides what is set via the `appSettings.json` file.

There are two options in this case:
- Either the domains for each of your Cloud environments can be added to your license.
- Or, for more control and to ensure this value is set correctly for other reasons, you can apply the configuration via code.

For example, in your `Startup.cs` file, you can add the following to the `ConfigureServices` method:

```csharp
services.Configure<WebRoutingSettings>(o => o.UmbracoApplicationUrl = "<your application URL>");
```

In practice, you will probably want to make this a bit more sophisticated. You can read the value from another configuration key, removing the need to hard-code it and have it set as appropriate in different environments. You can also move this code into a composer or an extension method if you prefer not to clutter up the `Startup.ConfigureServices` method.
