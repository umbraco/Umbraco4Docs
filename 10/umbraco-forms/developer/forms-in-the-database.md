# Umbraco Forms in the Database

In Umbraco Forms, it is _only_ possible to store Form data in the database.

If you are upgrading to Umbraco 9 and using Forms, you should first migrate the Forms to the database using Forms 8. For more information on migrating your Umbraco Forms data to the database, see the [Umbraco Forms in the Database](forms-in-the-database.md) article.
