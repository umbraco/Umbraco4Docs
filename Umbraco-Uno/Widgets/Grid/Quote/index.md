# Quote

The Quote widgets lets you add a piece of text that will then be placed in a box with a " on top.  You can add the author of the quote and their title as well as an image of the author.

One way to use the quote widget is if you have a text page and want to add a specific quote by someone then you could add the quote widget to emphasize the quote. Then it would stand out amongst all the other text and images.

## Sample

## Configuration options

As one of the grid widgets, quote has content configurations and the rest of the settings will have to be set up in the settings section of the grid itself.
