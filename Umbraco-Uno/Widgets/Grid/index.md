# The Grid

The Grid Widget lets you set up a framework of widgets and you will have the ability to make it look the way you want.

When you add the Grid widget you get to set up the general look of the grid, and choose what widgets you want it  to contain.

## Rows

A Row is a kind of shelf for the columns in the grid, and each row has a total column width of 100%. Say you wanted three columns on your row each of these would have to have a column width of 33%.

## Columns

Columns are the boxes wherein you create your content when working in a grid. Most of the grid widgets require you to set a column width. This is because it sets the width for how big the box will be and by that determine how many consecutive columns can be in a row.

## Using the Grid

It can be very beneficial to be using a grid because it makes sure that everything stays in the alignment that you have set up for the grid.
The grid is good for multiple reasons. It keeps your page-aligned beautifully and also provides you with a lot of great tools such as Navigation or Line break.

## Customizing the grid

The grid widget comes with a set of configuration options that can be used to customize how the grid is presented on the frontend.

It includes options such as deciding the alignment of the content, how close the columns should be placed together as well as a few options to change colors or adding a background image.
