# Latest from feed

The Latest From Feed widget is used to show posts from a **Feed** that you already have on your website. **Feed** here referring to the **Feed** content type.

Let us say that you want to have a blog on your page to share all your latest articles. A feed would be perfect for this because a feed will let you have article thumbnails on this page, and by clicking those, you will be taken straight to the article of your choice.

After the feed has been set-up, it will automatically add any new blog posts to the feed whenever you create a new one. Learn more about how to set up a blog on your website in the [How to set up a Blog](../../Creating-Content/How-to-Set-up-a-Blog-with-a-Feed) article.
