# Instagram widget

With the Instagram widget you can add more branding to your website by displaying a set of posts from your Instagram profile.

In order for this widget to work properly, you will need to configure a set of Instagram related settings on the [General settings](../../Uno-pedia/Settings/General-Settings) page.

## Sample

Here's how it looks when displaying 8 pictures from an Instagram account on an Umbraco Uno website.
