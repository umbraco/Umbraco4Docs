# Page

The Page content type is the default type to create landing pages using Umbraco Uno. Depending on which widgets is added to pages using this content type, it is possible to create customized landingpages for any purpose.

The content type contains the following groups of fields:

* Content group for widgets
* [SEO](../../Settings/Specific-Settings/#seo)
* [Settings](../../Settings/Specific-Settings/#settings)

Content items based on this type can be created as subpages to the Site (Start) content type and a subpages to items of the same type. This means that it's possible to create nested pages on the website based on the Page content type.

Use the [How to set-up a Landingpage](../../../Creating-Content/How-to-Set-Up-Landingpage) guide to learn how to work with the Page content type.
