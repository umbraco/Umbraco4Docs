# Themes

Umbraco Uno provides a lot of features and options designed to customize your website to be exactly what you need it to be.

In this article you will find more information about how to work with themes, fonts and colors in your Umbraco Uno project.

## Theme Editor

When you're previewing the content you're working with, you can use the **Theme Editor** to change colors on the website, set different fonts for the headings and text as well as customize various other aspects of the website.

To access the Theme Editor, follow these steps:

1. Select a piece of content from the Content tree
2. Use the *Preview* feature at the bottom of the page
3. Access the Theme Editor by selecting the green pencil-button in the right side of the screen

* **Footer**: Change the theme and size of the Footer
