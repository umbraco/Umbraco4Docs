# Creating content

When you are creating content in Umbraco Uno, you will have many tools to choose from. This page is designed to help you get started with these tools.

## Choosing the correct tools

When you want to create content it is a good idea to think about what tools to use for the job.

An example of this could be choosing between the Image widget and the Gallery widget. The Image widget only lets you add one image whereas the Gallery widget lets you set up a gallery of images and you can also choose to only select one image with that widget

Which of these two widgets you choose depends on what you need for your design of the website.

There is multiple ways to approach content creation, two of these ways are explained below. Both ways use the [Grid](../Widgets/Grid) feature:

### Widget based design and structure

If you do not have a predefined design you want to follow, coming up with a design and a structure based on the possibilities of widgets is a great way to start.

The grid widget gives you all the tools you would need to create a good looking website. All of these widgets are great to work with. Making a grid is a good way to secure a good structure, and these grids can be saved in global content to keep the same look and feel throughout you website pages.

### Fitting widgets to your already existing design and structure

If you already have a predefined design you need to achieve, the grid widget is a good option.

To get started it would be a good choice to start by setting up the grid structure in a global content page. Doing so will allow you to keep a consistent structure throughout your pages.

Using the grid in a global content page means you only have to set up the core structure for the page once, making your work more time efficient as you don't have to re-create the same page structure again and again - it's almost like copy/paste! 

## [Working With Content](Work-With-content/index.md)

## [Extending Uno](Extending-Uno)

Learn how you can extend Uno by enabling Custom Code or by embedding external services through widgets.

## [Navigation-menu](Navigation-menu)

The navigation menu is an essential part of any website. With Umbraco Uno you can choose to go with the default, auto-generated one or created a custom navigation where you have full control over the contents.

## [Manage Media Library](Manage-Media-Library/index.md)

## [Rich Text Editor](Rich-Text-Editors/index.md)

The Rich Text Editor or RTE as people call it is a great way to create content. It is a text editor, that allows you to write longer text pieces with all the formatting options you would need.

## [Working With Widgets](Working-With-Widgets/index.md)

When you're creating content in Umbraco Uno you will primarily be working with Widgets. These allow for a work process that is very straight forward, and they can be arranged in a grid for more complexity.
