# Organizations on Umbraco Cloud

On Umbraco Cloud, you can get an Umbraco Cloud Organization. With an Organization, you get an overview of all the projects that have been created by you and the members of your Organization.

If you are interested in getting an Organization, please reach out to our Support Team through the Chat box in your project overview.

## Managing your Organization

In the following sections, we will go through the different options that are available in an Organization:
