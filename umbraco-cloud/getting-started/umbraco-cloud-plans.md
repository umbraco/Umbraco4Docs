# Umbraco Cloud Plans

Umbraco Cloud plans Starter, Standard, and Professional are running on shared infrastructure, referred to as pools. To ensure performance and prevent exhaustion of a given pool, each website is assigned a resource quota, depending on the plan, and resource usage is continuously monitored.

The shared resources used by the Umbraco Cloud websites are:

- CPU
- RAM/Memory
- Disk space
- TCP connections

Currently, all available Umbraco Cloud plans are utilizing P1V3 Azure App Service Plans as their underlying infrastructure. A P1V3 Azure App Service Plan offers in total

- 2 CPU Cores
- 8GB of RAM
- 250 GB of Disk space
- 1,920 TCP connections

To ensure stable performance of all websites hosted on Umbraco Cloud shared plans, soft and hard quotas were put in place. Quotas per site and the number of sites in the pool vary per Umbraco Cloud Plan.

## Hard quotas for shared Umbraco Cloud Plans

Whenever a CPU or RAM quota is met, the website will be restarted within a minute to ensure stable performance for all websites in the pool. Meeting a disk quota will result in errors whenever performing write operations to disk. No hard limits exist for TCP connections per site, besides the total amount of TCP connections available to all sites in the pool set at 1,920, attempting to open new TCP connections afterwards will result in errors.

These are hard quotas, as they can't be broken for more than a minute and will immediately restrict the functionality of the site.

Umbraco Cloud Starter plan

- CPU - 20%
- RAM - 1500 MB
- Disk - 7800 MB

Umbraco Cloud Standard plan

- CPU - 40%
- RAM - 1800 MB
- Disk - 9600 MB

Umbraco Cloud Professional plan

- CPU - 50%
- RAM - 2000 MB
- Disk - 10400 MB

## Quotas for the shared pool

Whenever a pool hits above 95% usage of any resource disk, the busiest staging or development environment, that hasn't been moved previously will be moved to a different pool.
