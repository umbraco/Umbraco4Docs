# Known Limitations and Considerations

As we continue to gather insights from our users, there are some known limitations and considerations to be aware of.

## Potential Limitations and Considerations

**Format Restrictions**

* The packaged artifact from your CI/CD pipeline must adhere to the Umbraco Cloud API's required format, which is a zip source file. This could necessitate changes to your existing build and packaging scripts.

**Back Office Limitations**

* To ensure smooth execution of the Umbraco CI/CD Flow, it is highly recommended to adhere to a specific principle: refrain from making any alterations to the schema, except in the leftmost environment within the Umbraco Cloud back offices. The intention behind this principle is to prevent conflicts that could potentially arise due to simultaneous modifications made in different environments.

**Additional Build Step**

* The flow feature adds an extra build to the deployment process. As a result, it takes longer to post to Umbraco Cloud using Umbraco CI/CD Flow compared to standard deployments.

**Conflict Management**

* Given the necessity to avoid changes in other environments, the lack of strict coordination among multiple teams or individuals working on the same project elevates the risk of conflicts.

### Usage of Private NuGet Feeds

It is possible to reference private NuGet feeds [by using the Secrets Management feature](../../private-nuget-feed.md) on Umbraco Cloud. 

If you plan on using this feature, the first time you are setting up the private feed configuration has to be done manually. The guide describes how to correctly set it up. 

The initial setup is not possible through the CI/CD pipeline. This is because Umbraco Cloud collects the private NuGet credentials from your [left-most environment](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cloud/deployments/deployment). If your left-most environment doesn't have the credentials, then it will cause restore problems when trying to push the `NuGet.config` changes through CI/CD.

You can also add the correct credentials that reference your Umbraco Cloud secrets by following the steps below:
  1. Login to [Kudu](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cloud/set-up/power-tools) on your left-most environment.
  2. Navigate to your `NuGet.config` file via the console (the default location is the repository root).
  3. Edit the `NuGet.config` file to include your private feed and credentials.
  4. Save the file.
  5. Commit the changes while in Kudu.

After making sure that your `NuGet.config` has the credentials for your private feed, copy the `NuGet.config` file to your local project. You should be able to trigger the CI/CD flow successfully afterward.

## Key Points to Consider

* **Direct Commits to Umbraco Git Repos**: Any commits made directly to the Umbraco-git-repos will cause the process to fail.
* **Remote Build/Test Options**: It is currently not possible to skip the first build step before committing.
* **Incomplete API**:
  * The list endpoint lacks filtering capabilities.
  * The promotion endpoint for transitioning from dev to stage to live is not fully functional yet.
* **Hotfix Deployments**: Direct deployments to a specific environment are not supported at this time.
* **Lack of Predefined Tasks**: There are no Umbraco-provided Azure DevOps tasks or GitHub Actions available.
* **No Webhooks**: Currently, there's no webhook support for real-time feedback to the pipeline; polling is the only option.
* **Casing Conflicts**: Be cautious of casing issues, such as having a README.md file created by Azure DevOps and a `Readme.md` file from the default Umbraco Cloud, as this can cause conflicts in the cloud Git repository.
* **Documentation Alignment**: We are in the process of updating our documentation to align with standard Umbraco guidelines.
* **Developer Experience**: Plans are underway to create Umbraco-specific Azure DevOps tasks and GitHub Actions to enhance the developer experience.
