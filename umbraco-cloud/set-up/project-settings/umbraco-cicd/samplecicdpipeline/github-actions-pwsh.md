# GitHub Actions using Powershell scripts

Before setting up the pipeline in GitHub, make sure that the following steps from the [Configuring a CI/CD pipeline](./) are done:
- Use an existing Cloud project or create a new one
- Activate CI/CD Flow

You will need to define your pipeline in YAML, and find a way to interact with the Umbraco Cloud API.


{% hint style="info" %}
The Umbraco CI/CD Team have created a sample pipeline for GitHub Actions. 

The Scripts are provided as is. This means that the scripts will do the bare minimum for a pipeline that is utilizing the CI/CD flow. Adapt and integrate them into your own pipelines to gain the ability to do deployments to your Umbraco Cloud projects.

The sample includes YAML-files and custom Powershell scripts to interact with the Umbraco Cloud API.

You can get the samples for both `GitHub Actions` and `Azure DevOps` from the [Github repository](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Cloud.CICDFlow.Samples).

{% endhint %}

## Import Cloud project repository to GitHub
Go to your repositories in GitHub and click on "New".

- Create a new empty repository, and note down the clone URL.
- Go to the Umbraco Cloud Portal and clone your cloud project down locally. [This article](../../../working-locally.md#cloning-an-umbraco-cloud-project) describes how you can find the clone URL.
- Now working locally remove the Git Remote called `origin`, which points to Umbraco Cloud

 ```sh
 git remote remove origin
 ```

- Optionally rename branch `master` to `main`

 ```sh
 # optional step
 git branch -m  main
 git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/main
 ```

- Add a new remote called origin and pointing to the GitHub clone URL and push

 ```sh
 git remote add origin https://github.com/{your-organization}/{your-repository}.git
 git push -u origin --all
 ```

Now we can move on to setting up a pipeline.

## Set up Github repository variables

The pipeline needs to know which Umbraco Cloud project to deploy to. In order to do this you will need the `Project ID` and the `API Key`. [This article](README.md#obtaining-the-project-id-and-api-key) describes how to get those values.

- Now go to the repository in GitHub, and click on the Settings section.
- Expand secrets and variables in the left-hand menu titled `Security` and click on `Actions`.

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Security and Actions menu GitHub</p></figcaption></figure>

- Create a `repository secret` called `UMBRACO_CLOUD_API_KEY` with the `API Key` value from the Umbraco Portal.
- Create another `repository secret` with the name `PROJECT_ID` and the `Project ID` value from the Umbraco Portal.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to use other names for the secrets, you need to rename the `secrets` variables in each of `main.yml`'s jobs.

```yaml
jobs:
  cloud-sync:
    uses: ./.github/workflows/cloud-sync.yml
    secrets:
      projectId: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }} # change the part inside the curly braces
      umbracoCloudApiKey: ${{ secrets.UMBRACO_CLOUD_API_KEY }} # change the part inside the curly braces

  cloud-deployment:
    needs: cloud-sync
    uses: ./.github/workflows/cloud-deployment.yml
    secrets:
      projectId: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }} # change the part inside the curly braces
      umbracoCloudApiKey: ${{ secrets.UMBRACO_CLOUD_API_KEY }} # change the part inside the curly braces
```

{% endhint %}

Now Github is set up with the needed information to be able to run a deployment back to Umbraco Cloud.

Next up it setting up the actual pipeline.

### Allow GitHub to commit to your repository

The sample pipelines have a job called `cloud-sync`. This job is responsible for checking for changes in you Umbraco Cloud project, fetch them and apply them back to your repository. 
In order for this to work, you need to give the `GITHUB_TOKEN` write permissions to the repository during workflow runs.

This is how you can grant these permissions:

- Working in your repository on `GitHub`, click on `Settings` in the top right
- In the left sidebar, click on `Actions` and then on `General`
- Scroll down to the `Workflow permissions` sections
- Select the `Read and write permissions`
- Click save 

<figure><img src="../../../../.gitbook/assets/github-workflow-permissions.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>GitHub Workflow permissions</p></figcaption></figure>

## Set up the GitHub Actions pipeline

While working with the project on your local machine, follow these steps to prepare the pipeline, using the [samples from the repository](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Cloud.CICDFlow.Samples).

For GitHub Actions you will need the following files:
- From the root folder
  - `cloud.zipignore`
- From the `powershell` folder
  - `Get-LatestDeployment.ps1`
  - `Get-ChangesById.ps1`
  - `New-Deployment.ps1`
  - `Add-DeploymentPackage.ps1`
  - `Start-Deployment.ps1`
  - `Test-DeploymentStatus.ps1`
- From the `powershell/github` folder
  - `main.yml`
  - `cloud-sync.yml` 
  - `cloud-deployment.yml`

{% hint style="info" %}

Download the provided sample scripts as ZIP from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Cloud.CICDFlow.Samples/tree/main). Click on "Code" and then choose "Download ZIP". Then unzip it and use those files for the next steps.

{% endhint %}

Do the following to prepare the pipeline:
- Copy the `cloud.zipignore` file to the root of your repository
- Make a copy of the `.gitignore` from your repository and call the copy `cloud.gitignore`
  - Both files should be in the root of your repository
  - In the bottom of the `.gitignore` file add the line `**/git-patch.diff`
- Also in the root, create a folder called `.github`
- Inside `.github` create two additional folders
  - `workflows`
  - `powershell`
- Copy the 3 YAML files from the `github` folder into the `workflows` folder
- Copy the Powershell scripts from the `powershell` folder to the `powershell` folder
- Commit the all changes, and push to GitHub

The push will start a new pipeline run.

### Optional: Run a deployment to confirm

With everything set up, you may want to confirm that Umbraco Cloud reflects the changes you are sending via your pipeline.

While working on you project locally, add a new Document type.
- Commit the change to `main` and push to your repository.
- The pipeline starts to run
- Once the pipeline is done log into Backoffice on your left-most environment in Umbraco Cloud
- Go to the Settings section and see that your new Document type has been deployed 

## High level overview of the pipeline components

The mentioned scripts are provided as a starting point. It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the scripts and with documentation related to how to use GitHub Actions.

The scripts demonstrates the following:
 - How to sync your GitHub repository with the [left-most project environment](../../../../deployment/README.md) in Umbraco Cloud
 - How to deploy changes to the left-most project environment in Umbraco Cloud 

### Main

The `main.yml` is the main pipeline, and is the one that will be triggered on a push to `main` branch.
You can configure a different trigger behavior in this file.

You can add your Build and Test jobs between the `cloud-sync` and `cloud-deployment` jobs. 
Keep in mind that you do not need to retain the dotnet build artifact for upload later. The `cloud-deployment` job will take care of packaging all your source code and upload to Umbraco Cloud. 

### Cloud-sync

The `cloud-sync.yml` shows how you can sync your Github repository with the left-most environment of your Cloud project.
In this sample, it accepts any change from the API and applies and commits it back to the branch which triggered the pipeline. However the commit does not trigger the pipeline again.

If you don't want the pipeline to commit back to the triggering branch, this is where you need to change the pipeline. 

### Cloud-deployment

The `cloud-deployment.yml` show how you can deploy your repository to the left-most environment of your Cloud project.
The sample shows how to prepare for deployment, request the deployment and wait for cloud to finish.

There are a couple of things here to be aware of:
- We are overwriting the `.gitignore` file with `cloud.gitignore`.
  This is a way to accommodate your gitignore-needs when working locally. For instance you might want to ignore frontend builds, but you want them build and published to cloud.  
- We have a special `cloud.zipignore` file.
  This is a convenient way to tell the pipeline which files **not** to include when creating the zip package to send to cloud.

{% hint style="info" %}

If you have frontend assets that needs to be build (using tools like npm/yarn or others), you should add the needed steps before `Zip Source Code`. This is to ensure that the fresh frontend assets will be part of the package to be sent to cloud.
