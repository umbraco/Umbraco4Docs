From here you can see a list of all your projects. If you have many projects, you are able to search for specific projects from the search bar in the top right corner.

Clicking on a project will take you to the project where you will get an overview of your environment(s).

## Manage Environments

From here you are able to create multiple environments so you might have a Development environment as well. Depending on what plan you have chosen, you will have acces to one or more environment on your project.

If you want to add an environment all you have to do is click the big green button. Umbraco will create the environment for you.

When you are done you can go ahead and click on 'Done, take me back' in the top-right corner to get back to the project overview.

## Invite member

In the top-right corner you will find the **invite member** option. This will allow you to quickly invite new team members to your project from a modal that pops up. This makes it very fast and easy to invite new team members. Depending on your chosen plan, you might be charged an extra â‚¬5 euros per added team member.

### Webhooks

Here you are able to set up a webhook that will gather all the information related to deployments. This information is very useful if you har set up something like Slack integration so every time a deployment has been made a message will be posted.

### Upgrade plan

Here you will be able to upgrade your trial to a plan that fits your needs.

### Rename project

Here you are able to rename your project. All default umbraco.io hostnames will be updated to match the new name. When renaming a project you will also need to update the `Umb-Project-Alias` header when you are sending requests to the API, as changing the name of the project will also change the project alias.
