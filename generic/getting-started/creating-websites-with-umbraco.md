# Creating websites

In this section you will find information on which frameworks, languages and platforms to use with Umbraco to create user friendly and responsive websites.

There is a set of key concepts that you will need to familiarize yourself with. This section will give you the details you need as well as introduce you to how you can work with them in the Umbraco backoffice.

We've even included some helpful tutorials which you can follow for creating a basic site to get you started.

## How Umbraco works

Your website's content is based on **Document Types**. Each of these Document Types are structured by **Properties** made up of **Data Types**, and each Data Type has an underlying **Property Editor**.

Once you've created content based on the Document Types, they will be published on yourwebsite using **Templates**.
