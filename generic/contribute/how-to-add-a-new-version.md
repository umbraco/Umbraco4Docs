# Create a new version of an article

Our documentation is versioned in git branches. This means that there is a branch on the UmbracoDocs repository for each supported major version of Umbraco CMS.

{% hint style="info" %}
The documentation follows the Long Term Support (LTS) strategy for Umbraco CMS. This means that whenever a major version is End of Life (EOL), documentation for that version will be moved to GitHub.

Read the [Documentation and versions](../other-resources/documentation-and-versions.md) article to learn more about how to handle documentation for the different versions.
{% endhint %}

In order to create a new version of an article, follow these steps:

1. Use the version selector to choose the relevant version.
2. Follow our [Pull Request contribution guidelines](pull-request.md) to create a PR with the new documentation.
