# Contributing Guidelines
To contribute to either the documentation or stubs, you can fork & clone our repository, make your edits, and simply push back to GitHub and send us a pull request. All items that get pulled into the main repository will automatically get pushed to [our.umbraco.org/documentation](http://our.umbraco.org/documentation).

#### Getting started with Git and GitHub
 * [Setting up Git for Windows and connecting to GitHub](http://windows.github.com)
 * [Forking a GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
 * [The simple guide to GIT](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

## Repository organisation
All active work done on the documentation is currently being done on the `master` branch.

### Contributing documentation
All documents are written in Markdown, using a simple structure and stored as .md files.
These are then pulled to [our.umbraco.org/documentation](http://our.umbraco.org/documentation) for easy browsing.

First fork and clone the repository so that you have your own working copy. Then create a new branch on your local copy to make your changes. Once you are happy with your edits, use GitHub to issue a "pull request", which means your edits will be reviewed, and once accepted, merged into the main repository.

**Note:** It's a good idea to pull in upstream changes, merge and commit to your own fork before submitting a pull request. Instructions on how to set up a remote repo and pull from upstream can be found on this [page](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).

Everything in the main repository will make it onto the [our.umbraco.org/documentation](http://our.umbraco.org/documentation) site, which is why we have chosen a pull request workflow to keep everything simple and straightforward.

## Planning & discussions
Use [Github issues](https://github.com/umbraco/UmbracoDocs/issues) for reporting and discussing issues.
