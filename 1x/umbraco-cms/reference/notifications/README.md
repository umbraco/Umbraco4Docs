# Using Notifications

Umbraco uses Notifications (similar to the Observer pattern) to allow you to hook into the workflow process for the backoffice. For example, notifications allow you to execute some code every time a page is published.

## Notifications

All notifications reside in the `Umbraco.Cms.Core.Notifications` namespace and are postfixed with `Notification`.

Available notifications typically exist in pairs, with "before" and "after" notifications. For example, the ContentService class has the concept of **publishing** and **published** notifications. So, there is both a `ContentPublishingNotification` and a `ContentPublishedNotification` notification.

The notification to use depends on what you want to achieve. If you want to be able to cancel the action, you would use the `CancelOperation` method on the "before" notification. See the sample in [ContentService Notifications](contentservice-notifications.md). If you want to execute some code after the publishing has succeeded, then you would use the "after" notification.

### Notification handlers lifetime

It's important to know that the handlers you create and register to receive notifications will be **transient**. This means that they will be initialized every time they receive a notification. You can therefore not rely on them having a specific state based on previous notifications. 

As an example, you cannot do the following:

1. Create a list in a handler.
2. Add something when a notification is received.
3. Check if that list contains what you added in an earlier notification.

When following the steps above, the list will always be empty because the object has only been initialized.

If you need persistence between notifications, we recommend you move that functionality into a service or similar. You can then register it with the DI container, and inject it into your handler.

As previously mentioned, many notifications exist in pairs, with a "before" and "after" notification. There may be cases where you want to add some information to the "before" notification, which will then be available to your "after" notification handler. In order to support this, the notification "pairs" are **stateful**. This means the notifications contain a dictionary that is shared between the "before" and "after" notifications. You can add values to the dictionary, and later retrieve them like this:

```csharp
public void Handle(TemplateSavingNotification notification)  
{  
 notification.State["SomeKey"] = "Some Value Relevant to the \"after\" notification handler";  
}  
  
  
public void Handle(TemplateSavedNotification notification)  
{  
  var valueFromSaving = notification.State["SomeKey"];  
}
```

### Registering notification handlers

Once you've made your notification handlers, you need to register them with the `AddNotificationHandler` extension method on the `IUmbracoBuilder`. This enables them to run whenever a notification they subscribe to is published. There are two ways to do this: 

1. In the **Startup** class, if you're making handlers for your site
2. In a [**composer**](../../implementation/composing.md), if you're a package developer subscribing to notifications

#### Registering notification handlers in the startup class

In the Startup class, register your notification handler in the `ConfigureServices` after `AddComposers()` but before `Build()`:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
#pragma warning disable IDE0022 // Use expression body for methods
    services.AddUmbraco(_env, _config)
        .AddBackOffice()             
        .AddWebsite()
        .AddComposers()
        .AddNotificationHandler<ContentPublishingNotification, DontShout>()
        .Build();
#pragma warning restore IDE0022 // Use expression body for methods

}
```

The extension method takes two generic type parameters. The first, `ContentPublishingNotification`, is the notification you wish to subscribe to. The second, `DontShout`, is the class that handles the notification. This class must implement `INotificationHandler<>` with the type of notification it handles as the generic type parameter. In this case, the `DontShout` class definition looks like this:

```csharp
public class DontShout : INotificationHandler<ContentPublishingNotification>
```

For the full handler implementation, see [ContentService Notifications](contentservice-notifications.md).

#### Registering notification handlers in a composer

If you're writing a package for Umbraco you won't have access to the Startup class. You can instead use a composer, which gives you access to the `IUmbracoBuilder`. the rest is the same as when doing it in the Startup class:

```csharp
public class DontShoutComposer : IComposer
{
    public void Compose(IUmbracoBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.AddNotificationHandler<ContentPublishingNotification, DontShout>();
    }
}
```

#### Registering many notification handlers

You may want to subscribe to many notifications, meaning your `ConfigureServices` method or composer might become cluttered. You can avoid this by creating your own `IUmbracoBuilder` extension method for your events, keeping everything neatly wrapped up in one place, as follows:

```csharp
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.DependencyInjection;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Services.Notifications;

namespace MySite
{
    public static class UmbracoBuilderNotificationExtensions
    {
        public static IUmbracoBuilder AddDontShoutNotifications(this IUmbracoBuilder builder)
        {
            builder
                .AddNotificationHandler<ContentPublishingNotification, DontShout>()
                .AddNotificationHandler<TemplateSavingNotification, DontShout>()
                .AddNotificationHandler<MediaSavingNotification, DontShout>();
            
            return builder;
        }
    }
}
```

You can then register all these notifications by calling `AddDontShoutNotifications` in `ConfigureServices` or your composer, just like you would `AddNotificationHandler`:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
#pragma warning disable IDE0022 // Use expression body for methods
    services.AddUmbraco(_env, _config)
        .AddBackOffice()             
        .AddWebsite()
        .AddComposers()
        .AddDontShoutNotifications()
        .Build();
#pragma warning restore IDE0022 // Use expression body for methods

}
```

Now, your handler will handle all the notifications you registered in your extension method.

## Async Notification Handler

If you need to do anything asynchronously when handling a notification, you can achieve this using the `INotificationAsyncHandler`.

### Notification handler

Create an asynchronous handler by implementing the `INotificationAsyncHandler`:

```csharp
public class ContentDeletedHandler : INotificationAsyncHandler<ContentDeletedNotification>
{
    public async Task HandleAsync(ContentDeletedNotification notification, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // await anything
        await Task.Delay(1000);
    }
}
```

### Notification registration

When using the `INotificationAsyncHandler`, register it using the `IUmbracoBuilder` and the `AddNotificationAsyncHandler` extension method. This can be done in the Startup class or with a composer.

#### Registering notification async handlers in the startup class

Register your notification async handler to the `IUmbracoBuilder` in the Startup class:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddUmbraco(_env, _config)
        .AddBackOffice()             
        .AddWebsite()
        .AddComposers()
        .AddNotificationAsyncHandler<ContentDeletedNotification, ContentDeletedHandler>()
        .Build();
}
```

#### Registering notification async handlers in a composer

If you do not have access to the Startup class, use a composer instead:

```csharp
public class NotificationHandlersComposer : IComposer
{
    public void Compose(IUmbracoBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.AddNotificationAsyncHandler<ContentDeletedNotification, ContentDeletedHandler>();
    }
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Useful for manipulating the model before it is sent to an editor in the backoffice. It could be used to set a default value of a property on a new document.
{% endhint %}

## Creating and publishing your own custom notifications

Umbraco uses notifications to allow people to hook into different workflow processes. This notification pattern is extensible, allowing you to create and publish custom notifications, and other people to observe and hook into your custom processes. This approach can be very useful when creating Umbraco packages. For more information on how you create and publish your own notifications, see the [creating and publishing notifications](creating-and-publishing-notifications.md) article.
