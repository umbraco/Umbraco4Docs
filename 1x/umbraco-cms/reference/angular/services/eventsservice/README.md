# Events Service

The events service allows different components in Umbraco to broadcast and listen for global events.

## Using the events service in your custom code

### Broadcasting an event

To broadcast an event, you can use the `emit` function. It takes two arguments, where the first is the name of the event - eg. `featured.updated`, and the second argument is an object or similar describing the event.

The second argument is optional, so if your use case doesn't need this, feel free to skip this argument.

The illustrate this function, you could have a controller with an `updated` function that is triggered by the view. In this dummy example, the function will increment the value of a property editor, and then use the events service to broadcast that the value was updated:

```javascript
angular.module("umbraco").controller("MyController", function($scope, eventsService) {

    $scope.updated = function() {
        $scope.model.value++;
        eventsService.emit("feature.updated", { value: $scope.model.value });
    };

});
```

### Listening for an event

Another controller could then listen for broadcasts of your `feature.updated` event via the events service's `on` function, which takes the name of the event as the first argument, and a callback function as the second argument.

Then in the callback function, the first argument is the event it self, and the second argument is the object we pass on to the `emit` function when we're broadcasting:

```javascript
angular.module("umbraco").controller("MyOtherController", function($scope, eventsService) {

    $scope.count = 0;

    // Subscribe to the event
    var unsubscribe = eventsService.on("feature.updated", function(event, args) {
        $scope.count = args.value;
    });

    // When the scope is destroyed we need to unsubscribe
    $scope.$on("$destroy", function () {
        unsubscribe();
    });

});
```

#### Listening for events globally

Controllers are typically used by a specific component, so the controller will only be executed when such a component is inserted into the DOM. The controller will be executed for each component, so you may end of with multiple instances listening for the same event.

If you need to listen for events on a more global level, you can hook into the application startup using `app.run(...)`:

```javascript
app.run(function (eventsService) {

    $scope.count = 0;

    // Subscribe to the event
    var unsubscribe = eventsService.on("feature.updated", function(event, args) {
        $scope.count = args.value;
    });

});
```

### Unsubscribing from an event

Notice how the result of the `on` function is saved in an `unsubscribe` variable. When we add a listener via the `on` function, it's important to clean up after our selves when our component (here a controller) no longer exists - eg. when removed from the DOM.

In Angular, we can listen for the `$destroy` event in the current scope, and then unsubscribe from the events service by calling the `unsubscribe` variable as a function.

Alternatively, we could replace `unsubscribe()` with `eventsService.unsubscribe(unsubscribe)`, but it does the same thing - so calling the variable as a function directly may be preferred as it's shorter.

## Events in Umbraco

Below you'll find a list of events broadcasted by the Umbraco codebase. The list may not be complete, so please help updating the list should you find an event that isn't listed.

### Umbraco application

#### Init

**When the Umbraco application is ready**

```javascript
eventsService.emit("app.ready", data);
```

#### Security interceptor

When Umbraco our your custom code makes a request to the server via the `$http` service, Umbraco listens for the `x-umb-user-modified` header in the response. In can be used to tell the Umbraco backoffice that the current user has been modified, in which case Umbraco knows that it should refetch the user data.

```javascript
if (headers["x-umb-user-modified"]) {
    eventsService.emit("app.userRefresh");
}
```

### Services

```

**When an editor is closed**

```javascript
var args = {
    editors: editors,
    editor: closedEditor
};

// emit event to let components know an editor has been removed
eventsService.emit("appState.editors.close", args);
```

**When all editors are closed**

```javascript
var args = {
    editors: editors,
    editor: null
};

eventsService.emit("appState.editors.close", args);
```

#### Editor State service

```javascript
eventsService.emit("editorState.changed", { entity: entity });
```

#### Localization service

var result = { user: data, authenticated: true, lastUserId: lastUserId, loginType: "credentials" };
eventsService.emit("app.authenticated", result);
