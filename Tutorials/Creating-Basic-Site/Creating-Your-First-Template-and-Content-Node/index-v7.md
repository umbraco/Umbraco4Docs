# Creating (Editing) Your First Template


Next click the expand node icon (it's the small triangle) behind the **_Settings >_** **_Templates folder_** - you should then see a child node titled "_Homepage_".

Umbraco created this automatically when we created the **_Document Type_** (remember that option that said "..without template", we chose the one with and this is what it did).


Clicking on the **_Homepage node_** will load the template - which, except for a little bit of Razor code, is empty!

Leaving the code that's there (if you don't understand it, don't worry!) let's copy our template code in. Open up **_index.html_** from the **_Initializr_**  template in your favourite text editor (Notepad++ is good).  Copy and paste the whole thing into this template **after** the closing curly brace "}".  Your template should now look like below:

Click the **_Save_** button.


We now have a template. That's two out of the three stages complete for our first page.


# **Creating Your First Content Node**

Our third and final stage to creating our first page in Umbraco is to create a content node along with the Document Type and Template, to serve up an HTML page to web visitors.


We're now ready to create our first page in Umbraco!   Click the **_Content_** button (first option in the left-hand menu).


Hover over the grey text **_CONTENT_**  and you'll see the three dots **_..._** - click this.  If you've done everything correctly so far you should see the option to create our Homepage!

>If you can't see this then don't panic - check that **_Settings> Document Types > Homepage node_**  > **_Structure tab_** > **_Allow at root_** is checked.


Let's create our homepage. Click the icon and you'll see what we've been setting up - our document type is now going to drive our homepage content – it gives us and the editors the fields they need.


In the field at the top of the page you'll see "_Enter a name..._" click this and enter the name for your new content node.  We're going to call this "_Homepage_".

*Figure 15a - Create a Homepage - Enter a name...*


Fill in the following on the **_Contents_** tab:


>**_Page Title_** 	Welcome to Widgets Ltd
>
>**_Body Text_** 	Hello world! We can write what we like here!
>
>
>"Widgets Ltd 2014"


Click the Footer tab and enter:


>**Footer Text**	 "Copyright Widgets Ltd 2014"


Now click the green **_Save and publish_** button.  The menu will reload with our homepage node under the **_CONTENT_** label. And here's the good bit... go and refresh your webpage in your browser http://localhost – the default Umbraco page will be gone and we'll see a very bare, unstyled page! We’re getting there!

>If you see a blank page then check you entered your template markup and remembered to save it.
