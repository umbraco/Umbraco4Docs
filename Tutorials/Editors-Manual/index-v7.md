## Introduction

Umbraco is an information platform that allows you to quickly publish information onto a website without the need for any prior knowledge of web page editing. It is designed to be simple to use yet powerful and flexible enough to enable users full control of their website content.

No special skills are required in order to create, publish and manage web pages and related content with Umbraco. Any prior web page editing experience you may have might prove useful in terms of understanding what you want your website to do. Anything you can do using HTML can also be done in Umbraco.

The Umbraco platform can be utilized for all types of websites – from public websites to intranets and extranets, whether password protected or not. It can even be used to manage multiple websites from a single Umbraco instance. Regardless of the type, authorization to edit them can be given to anybody you choose and as editing is done via a web browser, it can be done at any time and in any place.

Umbraco is designed to be intuitive and straight-forward so the aim of this manual is to explain each step with clear instructions and help get you editing your website with ease.
