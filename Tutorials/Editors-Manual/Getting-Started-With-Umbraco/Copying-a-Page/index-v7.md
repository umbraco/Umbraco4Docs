# Copying a Page

If you want to re-use a page or structure you have created previously you can copy the page and its sub-pages to a different place within the site structure. When you copy a page all of its sub-pages will also be copied. You can define whether links should be automatically updated, or keep the linkage with the original pages.

1. You can either select the page you want to copy and click the ***Actions*** button in the top right, or alternatively you can right click the page title in the menu which will slide out the context menu.
2. Select ***Copy*** from the Actions menu.
3. Select the parent page which you want to copy the page.
4. Select whether to *Relate copied items to the original page.**
5. Click ***Move***.

:::warning
When you select ‘Relate copied items to the original page’ every change you make to the copied page will also be made to the original. So if you want the original and duplicated pages to be separate then do not select the ‘Relate copied items to the original page’ tick box.
