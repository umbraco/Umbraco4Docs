# Copying a Page

If you want to re-use a page or structure you have created previously you can copy the page and its child pages to a different place within the site structure. When you copy a page all of its child pages will also be copied as the default setting. You can choose to not have the child pages copied.
 You can define whether links should be automatically updated, or keep the linkage with the original pages.


1. You can either select the page you want to copy and click the ***Actions*** button in the top right. Alternatively, you can right-click the page title in the content tree which will slide out the context menu.
2. Select ***Copy*** from either the Actions menu or the menu presented by right-clicking the node in the tree.

4. Select whether to **Relate to original** page.
5. Select whether to **Include descendants** (child pages)
6. Click ***Move***.


:::warning
When you select **Relate to original** every change you make to the copied page will also be made to the original. So if you want the original and duplicated pages to be separate then do not select the **Relate to original** tick box.
