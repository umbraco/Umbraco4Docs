# Moving a Page

Pages can be moved between areas of the website by moving them in the tree view. Not all pages will be able to be moved below other pages depending on your specific set up. If you are unsure or need clarification, seek advice from your system administrator. To move a page:

1. Right click the page you want to move to reveal the context menu. Or alternatively you can click the ***Actions*** button in the top right right-hand corner.
2. Click on ***Move*** and select the parent page you would like to move this page under.
3. Click on the ***Move*** button to confirm the move and then you will see a confirmation message.
4. Click ***OK*** to dismiss the confirmation message
