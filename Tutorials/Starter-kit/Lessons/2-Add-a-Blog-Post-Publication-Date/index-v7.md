# Add a Blog Post Publication Date

In this lesson, you will learn how to add a new date property to blog posts.

## Outcome

Content editors can specify the publication date for a blog post. Blog posts are displayed with the most recent publication date appearing first.

## Takeaway

Learn how to:

* Add a new property to a Document Type
* Edit a Template to display the new property
* Sort a list of items by a new property

## Steps - Part One

1. In the **Settings** section, expand **Document Types**.
2. Click on *Blogpost*: this is the Document Type that defines the fields for this type of page.
3. On the right side, you can see two tabs called *Content* and *Navigation & SEO*.

    * At the bottom of the *Content* tab click **Add property**.
    * This opens the **Property Editor** dialog window.

4. Enter a Name of *Publication Date*.
5. Enter a Description of *The date of the blog post. This is the date used to display the most recent posts first.*.

    * Always try to add a meaningful description to help your editors.

6. Click **Add editor** to specify what type of data is being stored.  We need a standard date, so select the **Reuse** tab, then click on the **Date Picker** icon.
7. In the validation section tick to say that the field is Mandatory.
8. Click Submit to close the dialog.
9. Click the **Reorder** link near the top right of the pane, then drag the new property to be after *Page Title*.
    * A logical order to your properties will make things easier for your editors.
10. Click *Save*. A confirmation message should appear confirming that the Document Type was saved.
