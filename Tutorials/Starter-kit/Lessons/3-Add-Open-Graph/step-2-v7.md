# Add Open Graph - Step 2

You are now going to add the tab and properties to the home page and blog post of the site. This is done by using compositions to add the functionality in multiple places.

1. In the Settings section, expand the Document Type tree.
2. Find the `Home` document type, select it and click **Compositions**
3. Choose the `Open Graph` composition.
4. Save the document type

This will add the tab and properties you created to the Home document type. Follow the same steps for the `Blogpost` document type.

## Reviewing the changes

If you go to the content section and select Home you can now see your changes (the same of course goes for the blog posts).
