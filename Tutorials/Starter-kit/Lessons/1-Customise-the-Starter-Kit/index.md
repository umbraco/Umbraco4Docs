A customised version of the site with your own Home page image, site name, color theme, font, and perhaps a logo in the header.

## Takeaway

* Navigate the editing area in the Content section.
* Interact with content properties.
* Upload images and use them with content items.

## Steps

1. Click on *Home* in the Content section.
2. Navigate to the *Design* group by scrolling down or selecting it from the dropdown menu.

3. Choose a different font and color theme.

    * Try different combinations and see what fits your site.
    * Save a draft of your changes by using `ctrl`/`cmd`+`s` or clicking the arrow next to the **Save and Publish** button. **Save** will not publish the changes to the website.
    * Click **Preview** to see how the page looks on various screen sizes.

4. Try changing the background image of the Home page.

    * Hover over the *Hero Background* thumbnail and click the red cross icon to remove the current image.
    * You can now click the '+' to open a dialog where you can chose an image from the Media library or upload a new image.
    * Select the image you want and click Submit in the lower right corner.

5. Find the *Site Name* property and change the name of the site.

    * This is shown in the site navigation menu.
    * If you want a logo instead of the Site Name you can upload and/or choose an image from the Media Library.

6. When you're happy with the changes publish them to website by clicking the Save and Publish button.

To see the changes you've made go to the Info tab and select the link.
