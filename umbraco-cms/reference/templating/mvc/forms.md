# Creating Forms

Creating an HTML form to submit data with MVC in Umbraco is possible in a few steps.

If you want to create a Form:

1. Using view models, views, controllers, and a handy HtmlHelper extension method called BeginUmbracoForm, see the [Creating Forms](../../../fundamentals/code/creating-forms.md) article.
2. Using Umbraco Forms, see the [Umbraco Forms Documentation](../../../../umbraco-forms/) article.
