# Extending Umbraco

## [Dashboards](dashboards.md)

A Dashboard is a component for displaying elements on the right-hand side of the backoffice UI area.

## [Sections & Trees](section-trees/)

The Umbraco backoffice consists of sections (sometimes referred to as applications) which contain trees. For example, when you load the backoffice you'll see that the 'Content' section contains one tree: the content tree whereas the 'Settings' section contains a number of trees: Stylesheets, Content Types, Media Types, etc...

Both sections and trees can be created to extend Umbraco.

## [Property Editors](property-editors/)

A property editor is the editor used to insert content into Umbraco. [See here for definition.](property-editors/)

This section will describe how to work with and create Property Editors.

## [Macro Parameter Editors](macro-parameter-editors.md)

This section will describe how to work with and create Parameter Editors.

## [Health Check](health-check/)

Developers can create their own Umbraco Health Checks and Health Check notification methods.

## [FileSystemProviders (IFileSystem)](filesystemproviders/)
