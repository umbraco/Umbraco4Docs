#ContentService Events#

The ContentService class is the most commonly used type when extending Umbraco using events. ContentService implements IContentService. It provides easy access to operations involving IContent.

    <tr>
        <td>Creating</td>
        <td>(IContentService sender, NewEventArgs&lt;IContent&gt; e)</td>
        <td>
        Raised when ContentService.CreateContent is called in the API. <br />
        The event is fired after the ContentType, ParentId and Name of the IContent object have been set. <br/>
        "sender" will be the current IContentService object.<br />
        "e" will provide:
            <ol>
                <li>Entity: Gets the IContent object being created.</li>
                <li>Alias: Gets the ContentTypeAlias of the IContent object being created.</li>

        <td>(IContentService sender, NewEventArgs&lt;IContent&gt; e)</td>
        <td>
        Raised when ContentService.CreateContent is called in the API.<br />
        The event is fired after the CreatorId and WriterId of the Content object have been set.<br />
        NOTE: The IContent object has been created, but not saved so it does not have an identity yet (meaning no Id has been set).<br />
        "sender" will be the current IContentService object.<br />
        "e" will provide:
            <ol>
                <li>Entity: Gets the created IContent object.</li>

        NOTE: It can be skipped completely if the parameter "raiseEvents" is set to false during the Save method call (true by default).<br />
        "sender" will be the current IContentService object.<br />
        "e" will provide:

        Raised when ContentService.Save is called in the API and after data has been persisted.<br />
        NOTE: It can be skipped completely if the parameter "raiseEvents" is set to false during the Save method call (true by default). <br />
        "sender" will be the current IContentService object.<br />

        The event is fired after a copy object has been created and had its parentId updated and its state has been set to unpublished. <br />
