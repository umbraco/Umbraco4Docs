This is useful for all sorts of situations such as relating a page to numerous other pages, creating a list of images/files from the media section, etc... 

Multi-Node Tree Picker was originally in uComponents but was included in the Umbraco Core v4.8 

The current version supports:

* Rendering either the Media or Content tree
* Choosing a starting node ID for the tree
* An XPath filter to match the nodes that should, OR should not be clickable/selectable in the tree
* Thumbnail preview for selected images when working with the media tree
* Thunbmail preview can be enabled/disabled
* Set a maximum number of nodes to be selected, by default this is unlimited
* Information tooltip display for each selected item which can be toggled on/off
* The tooltip display contains a link to edit the selected item
* The option to save as valid XML data for easy retrieval even in XSLT, OR saving as CSV (comma separated values)
* Drag/Drop sorting of selected nodes


##Multiple Textstring
The Multiple Textstring data-type enables a content editor to make a list of text items. For best use with an unordered-list.

Multiple Textstring was originally in uComponents but was included in the Umbraco Core v4.8 

##No Edit
Is a non-editable control, can only be used to display a present text. It can also be used in the media section to load in values related to the node, such as width, height and file size.

##Picker Relations

##Radiobutton List
Pretty much like the name indicates this Data type enables editors to choose from list of radiobuttons. The settings for this data type include the data storage type (Date, Integer, Ntext, Nvarchar) and the prevalues the RadioButton list should hold.

##Related Links
This datatype allows an editor to easily add an array of links. These can either be internal Umbraco pages or external URLs.

##Slider
The Slider data-type makes use of the jQuery UI Slider plugin, which makes selected elements into sliders. The slider can be moved with the mouse or the arrow keys.

##Tags
A textbox that allows you to use multiple tags on a docType - This is what is used on Blog4Umbraco and is perfect if you need to categorise data.  You can specify a TAG Group when creating new versions of this datatype, in case you need to use TAGS on different sections of your site (i.e  News, Article, Events).

##Textbox multiple
A simple textarea control to import text

##Textbox
A normal html input text field

##TinyMCE v3 wysiwyg
The TinyMCE based wysiwyg editor. This is the standard editor used to edit any larger amount of text. The editor has a lot of settings, which can be changed under the developer section in "data types" / Richtext editor. The editor also supports TinyMCE plugins which can be controlled in the configuration file located at /config/tinyMce.config

##True/False (Ja/Nej)
A simple checkbox which saves either 0 or 1, depending on the checkbox being checked or not.

##Ultimate picker
The Ultimate picker is a flexible document picker where you can set the root for the picker as well as of what type (Autocomplete, CheckboxList, DropDownList, ListBox, RadioButtonList) the picker should be. Other settings are on which Document Types the picker should filter, and if it should show Grandchildren of the root.  

##UltraSimpleEditor
A very scaled down editor which only has bold, italic and link - It does not render the HTML live like the richtext editor, but shows the raw HTML and simply surrounds the selected text with the limited HTML tag buttons at the top.

##umbraco usercontrol wrapper
The umbraco usercontrol wrapper datatype enables to create a custom Data type that references a .NET User Control, given that the User Control dll has been copied to the /bin folder and the User Control ascx file has been copied to the /usercontrols directory

##Upload field
Adds an upload field, which allows documents or images to be uploaded to umbraco. This does not add them to the media library, they are simply added to the document data.

##XPath CheckBoxList
Uses an XPath expression to select nodes from the content tree to use as the checkbox options. The advantage of using XPath to define the nodes to use is that it allows a granular selection throughout the whole tree.

Can use $currentPage and also $parentPage within the XPath expression (including use within any XPath predicates). ($parentPage allows the expression to be evaluated when the current node is unpublished, and the XPath expression depends on finding nodes based on a current ancestor).

The property value stored can be a CSV string or an XML fragment of Node Ids or Node names.

XPath CheckBoxList was originally in uComponents but was included in the Umbraco Core v4.8

##XPath DropDownList
Uses an XPath expression to select nodes from the content tree to use as the dropdown options. The advantage of using XPath to define the nodes to use is that it allows a granular selection throughout the whole tree.

The property value stored can be the Node Id or Node name.

XPath DropDownList was originally in uComponents but was included in the Umbraco Core v4.8
