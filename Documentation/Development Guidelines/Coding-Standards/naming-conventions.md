When developing new Class Libraries we will be adhereing as closely as possible to the official guidelines as proposed by Microsoft [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229042.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229042.aspx)

Another good reference is "Framework Design Guidelines: Conventions, Idioms, and Patterns for Reusable .NET Libraries" book by Krzysztof Cwalina and Brad Abrams

Resharper settings are included with the solution, so developers can cleanup code in a consistent manner.
