#Umbraco in Load Balanced Environments

_Information on how to deploy Umbraco in a Load Balanced scenario and other details to consider when setting up Umbraco for load balancing._

##Overview
Configuring and setting up a load balanced server environment requires planning, design and testing. This document should assist you in setting up your servers, load balanced environment and Umbraco configuration. 

This document assumes that you have a fair amount of knowledge about:

* Umbraco
* IIS 7+
* Networking & DNS
* Windows Server (2008/2012)
* .NET Framework

__It is highly recommended that you setup your staging environment to also be load balanced so that you can run all of your testing on a similar environment to your live environment.__

##Design
These instructions make the following assumptions:

* All servers are part of the same domain
* All servers are on the same network/subnet
* You have administration access to all servers
* All servers can communicate via HTTP protocol with each other
* You should be running in ASP.NET Full Trust (medium trust may cause some issues with load balancing)
* _**You will designate a single server to be the back-office server for which your editors will log into for editing content.**_ Umbraco out-of-the-box currently *(coming soon...)* will not seamlessly work if the back-office is behind the load balancer *(see DNS for more information below)*. If you require that the back office is load balanced you may have to do additional custom development to ensure this works seamlessly.

There are two design alternatives you can use to effectively load balance servers:

1. Each server hosts copies of the load balanced website files and a file replication service is running to ensure that all files on all servers are up to date. __This is the recommended approach.__ 
2. The load balanced website files are located on a centralized file share (SAN/NAS/Custered File Server/Network Share).

And you'll obviously need a load balancer to do your load balancing!

##DNS
Each server in your cluster will require a custom unique DNS name assigned to the host header for the IIS install for this website. This is so Umbraco knows which server nodes to replicate its cached content with.

An example of how to setup DNS and host headers between 3 load balanced servers:

Server 1

* domain DNS name: server1.mydomain.local
* internal website DNS name: server1.mywebsite.com (use for IIS host header)
* IP Address: 192.168.1.10

Server 2

* domain DNS name: server2.mydomain.local
* internal website DNS name: server2.mywebsite.com (use for IIS host header)
* IP Address: 192.168.1.11

Server 3

* domain DNS name: server3.mydomain.local
* internal website DNS name: server3.mywebsite.com (use for IIS host header)
* IP Address: 192.168.1.12

Of course you'll have your public website's DNS/address which you'll also need to add to the host header for each of your IIS server's websites. For instance, if the public website address is: http://www.mywebsite.com then you'll need to add www.mywebsite.com as a host header to IIS website on each server. This DNS entry will point to the public IP address of your load balancer.

###Back office server

You should designate one of these servers to be the back-office server for which your editors will use to log in to and edit content. This can be acheived by creating another public DNS entry/host header that you can assign to your designated server. 

As an example, you could assign Server 1 as the designated back-office server. In this case you could create a DNS entry such as **admin.mywebsite.com** and add as a host header to Server 1. 

You will then need to ensure that any public request going to this DNS entry only goes to Server 1. This can be acheived by assigning a secondary public IP address to the DNS entry and configuring your firewall to NAT this IP address to your Server 1 internal IP address. Other alternatives could possibly be acheived based on your firewall and the configuration that it supports.

##Load Balancer
A load balancer will balance the traffic between your servers. There are many load balancers out there and hardware ones are generally the most effective way to balance traffic. If you don't have a hardware load balancer, don't worry - you can use software. Windows Server comes with [NLB (Network Load Balancing)](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc758834%28WS.10%29.aspx). It's relatively easy to setup and free.

Some important notes on NLB:

* [Load balancing with VMWare & NLB](http://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/implmenting_ms_network_load_balancing.pdf)
* Ensure that the internal IP Addresses for NLB have DNS registration disabled, are not configured to a a client for Microsoft Networks and have Netbios over TCPIP disabled
* Windows Server 2008 changed the way that TCP-IP works and have disabled forwarding. In order for NLB to work with 2 network cards (the recommended way), you have to enable forwarding for the private NIC:
	* [Article 1](http://www.numtopia.com/terry/blog/archives/2008/10/windows_2008_nlb_with_2_nics.cfm)
	* [Article 2](http://www.windowsreference.com/windows-server-2008/dual-nic-nlb-configuration-with-windows-server-2008-nlb-clusters/)

##File Storage with File Replication

*This is the recommended setup*

A common way to replicate files on Windows Server is to use [DFS](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb540031(v=vs.85).aspx), which is included with Windows Server.

Additional DFS resources:

* [Implementing DFS Replication in Windows Server 2003](http://www.windowsnetworking.com/articles_tutorials/Implementing-DFS-Replication.html)
* [Overview of DFS Replication in Windows Server 2008 R2](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc771058.aspx)
* [Watch an intro to installing and working with DFS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYfBoUt2RVE)

There are other alternatives for file replication out there, some free and some licensed. You'll need to decide which solution is best for your environment.

###Non-replicated files

When deploying Umbraco in a load balanced scenario using file replication, it is important to ensure that not all files are replicated - otherwise you will experience file locking issues. Here are the folders and files that should not be replicated:

* ~/App_Data/TEMP/*
* ~/App_Data/umbraco.config 
	* Alternatively you can change the web.config entry to store this file inside of the ~/App_Data/TEMP folder using this
	
			<add key="umbracoContentXML" value="~/App_Data/TEMP/umbraco.config" />
	* Another alternative is to store the umbraco.config file in the local server's 'temp' folder. Achieve this by changing this configuration setting to 'true' in the web.config. The downside is that if you need to view this configuration file you'll have to find it in the temp files. Locating the file this way isn't always clear.
			
			<add key="umbracoContentXMLUseLocalTemp" value="true" /> 
* ~/App_Data/Logs/*
	* This is **optional** and depends on how you want your logs configured (see below) 

If for some reason your file replication solution doesn't allow you to not replicate specific files folders (which it should!!) then you can use an alternative approach by using virtual directories. *This is not the recommended setup but it is a viable alternative:*

* Edit /web.config and change the umbracoContentXML to use ~/App_Data/TEMP/umbraco.config.
* Copy the /App_Data/TEMP directory to each server, outside of any replication areas or to a unique folder for each server.
* Create a virtual directory (not a virtual application) in the /App_Data folder, and name it TEMP. Point the virtual directory to the folder you created in step 2.
* You may delete the /App_Data/TEMP folder from the file system - not IIS as this may delete the virtual directory - if you wish.

###Additional important notes

####Logging
Since Umbraco uses log4net for logging, there are various configurations that can ensure logging is done the way you would like. If you are replicating your logs - which you may wish to do to ensure that all of your servers have the other server logs - then you'll want to ensure that your logs are named with file names that include the machine name. Otherwise you'll get file locks or your logs will get overwritten. *(See below for details on how to do this)* 

Other options include changing your log4net setup to log to a centralized database. Of course, if your database cannot be accessed then no logging will occur so be aware of this.

###IIS Setup

IIS configuration is pretty straightforward with file replication. IIS is just reading files from its own file system like a normal IIS website.

##File Storage on SAN/NAS/Clustered File Server/Network Share

Configuring your servers to work using a centrally located file system that is shared for all of your IIS instances can be tricky and can take a while to setup correctly. 

A note when using this method to store your files centrally, you **must** make sure that your file storage system is HA (Highly Available) which means that there's not single point of failure. If you're hosting your files on a File Server share, you need to make the file share clustered (using [MSCS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Cluster_Server) or similar). Windows Server 2008 supports connecting directly to a SAN via [iSCSI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISCSI) if your SAN supports it (there are also many other ways to connect to a SAN to share folders), otherwise you should be able to connect to a NAS via a UNC path but you must ensure that it is a windows/NTFS file system - IIS will not work properly using a linux shared file system.

There's a lot of work required to get this working, but once it's done it's fairly easy to maintain. We've this same setup working for many websites so hopefully these notes help you get started:

###Umbraco configuration

One important configuration option that **must** be set when using a centralized storage is to store the umbraco.config file in the ASP.NET temp folder local to the individual server. Change this setting to 'true' in your web.config

	<add key="umbracoContentXMLUseLocalTemp" value="true" /> 

###Lucene/Examine configuration

_**Lucene/Examine will have issues with this configuration!**_. Even though you've specified a single server as the administration server, when this server makes distributed calls to the other servers in your load balanced environment, each of those servers will attempt to write to their index files. Since these index files are shared between all servers you will get file locking issues. 

Therefore you need to setup Examine to store index files on the local machine. This can be done with this custom library:

https://github.com/Shandem/UmbracoExamine.TempStorage

Or you might decide to write your own Examine providers that store the index files for each server in a server name specific folder so each server is writing to their own index. It's worth noting however that you might experience latency issues with Lucene when running over a file share since the file access is being done over the network. In this case, using the library above will solve that problem since the index will be running locally.

###Windows Setup

* Create domain user account that will run your IIS websites. Example: MyDomain\WebsiteUser
* Grant this domain user FULL access to your file share
* On each web server, add this user to the IIS Security group account. Server 2003: IIS_WPG, Server 2008: IIS_IUSRS
* The .NET Code Access Policy must be updated on each server to run with Full Trust for the UsterNC share:
** EXAMPLE: %windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727\caspol -m -ag 1. -url "file://\\fileserver.mydomain.local\Inetpub\MySite\*" FullTrust -name "WebsiteUser"
* The IIS user above needs to be granted the appropriate IIS permissions:
** EXAMPLE: %windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727\Aspnet_regiis.exe -ga ActiveDirectoryDomain\ProcessIdentity
* Restart the server

**Much of the above is covered in this Microsoft doc: [ASP.NET 3.5 Hosting](http://wiki.dev/GetFile.aspx?File=Wiggles-Hosting/ASPNET35_HostingDeploymentGuide.doc)**

###IIS Setup

Since the files for the website will be hosted centrally, each IIS website on your servers will need to point to the same UNC share for the files. For example: *\\fileserver.mydomain.local\Inetpub\MySite*

* Point to the shared file server: \\fileserver.mydomain.local\Inetpub\MySite
* "Connect To" this share with the user account created above
* Have their application pools run as the user above
* Have the IIS anonymous user account set to the application pool account (IIS 7)

###Additional important notes

####Logging
Since Umbraco is using log4net for logging there are various configurations that you can use to ensure logging is done the way that you'd like. If you are using file based logs you'll want to ensure that your logs are named with file names that include the machine name, otherwise you'll get file locks. *(See below for details on how to do this)*

Other options include changing your log4net setup to log to a centralized database - of course if your database cannot be accessed then no logging will occur so be aware of this.

##ASP.NET Configuration

* You will need to use a custom machine key so that all your machine key level encryption values are the same on all servers, without this you will end up with view state errors, validation errors and encryption/decryption errors since each server will have its own generated key.
	* Here are a couple of tools that can be used to generate machine keys:
		* 	[http://www.betterbuilt.com/machinekey/](http://www.betterbuilt.com/machinekey/)
		* 	[http://www.developerfusion.com/tools/generatemachinekey/](http://www.developerfusion.com/tools/generatemachinekey/)
	* 	Then you need to update your web.config accordingly, note that the validation/decryption types may be different for your environment depending on how you've generated your keys.

			<configuration>
			  <system.web>
			    <machineKey decryptionKey="Your decryption key here" 
			                validationKey="Your Validation key here"
							validation="SHA1"
							decryption="AES" />
			  </system.web>
			</configuration>
* If you use SessionState in your application, or are using the default TempDataProvider in MVC (which uses SessionState) then you will need to configure your application to use the SqlSessionStateStore provider (see [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa478952.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa478952.aspx) for more details).

##Umbraco Configuration

Configuring Umbraco to support load balanced clusters is probably the easiest part. In the /config/umbracoSettings.config file you need to updated the distributed call section to the following (as an example)
	
	<distributedCall enable="true">
	    <user>0</user>
	    <servers>
	       <server>server1.mywebsite.com</server>
	        <server>server2.mywebsite.com</server>
	        <server>server3.mywebsite.com</server>
	    </servers>
	</distributedCall>

As you can see in the above XML the distributed server names are the custom DNS names created for each IIS host name for each server.  Don't forget to enable the distributedCall.

There are a couple optional elements for the configuration of each server that allow you to specify a specific protocol or port number:

	<server forceProtocol="http|https" forcePortnumber="80|443">server3.mywebsite.com</server>

If you only add https bindings to your site in IIS, then you will need to set umbracoUseSSL="true" in your web.config in order for publish to work.

### Correct config for scheduled publishing & tasks

As of Umbraco 6.2.1+ and 7.1.5+ there are another couple of options to take into account:

* If you have your load balancing environment setup with a 'master' server, Umbraco will assume that the **first** server listed in the configuration is the 'master'
* For scheduled publishing and scheduled tasks to work properly, each server listed needs to know if it is the 'master' server or not. In order to achieve this there are 2 optional attributes for a server configuration node: serverName or appId

**serverName** will be the most common attribute to use and will always work so long as you are not load balancing a single site on the same server. In this case you should add the serverName attribute to each server node listed so that each server knows if it is a master or slave and so that each server knows which internal URL it can use to ping itself. Take not that the serverName must match the machine name otherwise scheduled tasks will not work
Example:

		
		<server serverName="MyServer1">server1.mywebsite.com</server>
	        <server serverName="MyServer2">server2.mywebsite.com</server>
	        <server serverName="MyServer3">server3.mywebsite.com</server>
	        
**appId** is a less common attribute to use but will need to be used in the case where you are load balancing a single site on the same server. The appId is determined by the result of: `HttpRuntime.AppDomainAppId`. This is generally the id of the IIS site hosting the web app (i.e. the value might look something like: /LM/W3SVC/69/ROOT ). You shouldn't specify both the serverName and appId together on the same xml server node, if you do the appId will take precedence. Example:

		<server appId="/LM/W3SVC/987/ROOT">server1.mywebsite.com</server>
	        <server appId="/LM/W3SVC/123/ROOT">server2.mywebsite.com</server>
	        <server serverName="MyServer3">server3.mywebsite.com</server>

**7.1.5 & 7.1.6** - If IIS uses the same site ID on each server, it *can* cause the cache to not refresh. Set them differently on each server if the cache fails to update, it can be edited in IIS via advanced settings.

##Testing
You'll need to test this solution **a lot** before going to production. You need to ensure there are no windows security issues, etc... The best way to determine issues is have a lot of people testing this setup and ensuring all errors and warnings in your application/system logs in Windows are fixed.

To test Umbraco distributed calls, just create and publish some content on one server (i.e. http://server1.mywebsite.com/umbraco/umbraco.aspx), then browse to the front end content on another server (i.e. http://server2.mywebsite.com/public/page1.aspx if page1 was the newly published content). If the page shows up on the 2nd server, though it was published from the 1st server, then distributed calls are working! You'll need to thoroughly test this though.

##Log4net file logging with machine name
This describes how you can configure log4net to write log files that are named with the machine name.

Simply update your log4net configuration as below:

	  <appender name="AsynchronousLog4NetAppender"
	            type="Umbraco.Core.Logging.AsynchronousRollingFileAppender, Umbraco.Core">
	    <!--
			THIS IS THAT VALUE THAT UMBRACO IS SHIPPED WITH THAT DOES NOT
			INCLUDE THE MACHINE NAME IN THE FILE
			<file value="App_Data\Logs\UmbracoTraceLog.txt" />
		-->

		<!-- THIS IS THE NEW CHANGE TO HAVE A MACHINE NAME IN THE FILE NAME -->
	    <file type="log4net.Util.PatternString" value="App_Data\Logs\UmbracoTraceLog.%property{log4net:HostName}.txt" />

	    <lockingModel type="log4net.Appender.FileAppender+MinimalLock" />
	    <appendToFile value="true" />
	    <rollingStyle value="Date" />
	    <maximumFileSize value="5MB" />
	    <layout type="log4net.Layout.PatternLayout">
	      <conversionPattern value="%date [%thread] %-5level %logger - %message%newline" />
	    </layout>
	  </appender>

##Conclusion
Though this is somewhat detailed, this is still a basic overview since all environments are different in some way. Hopefully this guide will point you in the right direction!
