#Install Umbraco with NuGet

_Follow these steps to do a full install of Umbraco with NuGet._

##NuGet version
Before you start: make sure your NuGet version is up to date. We use the latest version while testing and can't guarantee that the install process works with older versions of NuGet.

In Visual Studio, go to Tools > Extensions and Updates, then Updates > Visual Studio Gallery. Check if there's a NuGet Update available and install it.

Also make sure that the execution policy in the Package Manager Console is set to **RemoteSigned**. You can check this by going to Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console. Once that loads, type `Get-ExecutionPolicy` if it's set to "Restricted" then make sure to change that by typing the following command: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`

##Install NuGet in Visual Studio
If you don't already have NuGet installed, you can read all about the installation process here: [http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/installing-nuget](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/installing-nuget).

##New solution
To install Umbraco we need a Visual Studio solution to install it in. 

###.NET Version
![](images/NuGet/new-project-dotnet4.png)

If you're installing Umbraco 7+ then you need to choose .NET Framework 4.5 or 4.5.1 here.  
For Umbraco 6 you can still choose .NET Framework 4 but 4.5 and 4.5.1 also work.

###Visual Studio 2012  
Go to **File > New Project** and pick ASP.NET Web Application. Click **OK** and then choose one of the following:

* ASP.NET Empty Web Application
* ASP.NET Web Forms Application
* ASP.NET MVC 3 Web Application (will be upgraded to an MVC 4 application)
* ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Application

Some of these have a second step, pick the **Empty** template on that second step.  
It's important to pick only one of those as other templates cause errors beyond our control.

###Visual Studio 2013
Go to **File > New Project** and pick an ASP.NET **Empty** Web Application.   
It's important to pick **empty** as other templates include incompatible versions of MVC and Json.NET. (Don't enable any of the checkboxes to add folders or core references. Umbraco will add them for you).

Or you can use one of the VS2012 templates:

* ASP.NET Empty Web Application
* ASP.NET Web Forms Application
* ASP.NET MVC 4 Web Application

Again, if there's a next step, then choose **Empty** to prevent conflicts.

##Finding and installing the Umbraco package
The latest release of Umbraco is always available in the NuGet gallery. All you have to do is search for it and install.

To install Umbraco from the Visual Studio interface, right-click on the new project you just made and choose **Manage NuGet Packages**.

You can then use the search function to find the package called **Umbraco CMS**. You'll also find the Umbraco CMS Core Binaries package, which will be included automatically when you choose Umbraco CMS. So make sure to pick Umbraco CMS (highlighted in the image below) and click **Install**.

NuGet will then download dependencies and will install all of Umbraco's files in your new solution.

During this process it will ask if it is allowed to overwrite your web.config file. In this case, overwriting the file is safe because we just started a new project. If you're installing Umbraco in an existing project, however, you might want to create a backup of your existing web.config file before answering "Yes". For some inexplicable reason, the installation will fail if you answer "Yes to All". So make sure to **only answer "Yes"**. (You may need to do this a few times).

##Package manager console
You can do the exact same thing from the package manager console, which is a bit quicker as you don't have to click through the menus and search.

Enable the console by going to **Tools >  Library Package Manager >  Package Manager Console**.

Then simply type `Install-Package UmbracoCms` to start installing the latest version of Umbraco.

**Note**  
For some inexplicable reason, the installation will fail if you answer "A" to the question: 
`File 'Web.config' already exists in project 'MySite'. Do you want to overwrite it?`
`[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [?] Help (default is "N"):`  
So make sure to **only answer "Y"**. (You may need to do this a few times).

##Running the site
You can now run the site like you would normally in Visual Studio (using **F5** or the **Debug** button).

Follow the installation wizard and after a few easy steps and choices you should get a message saying the installation was a success.
