#Version specific upgrades

*For now, this document will only list updates from the past two years, but it will eventually be improved to go further back.*

Most of the time you will be able to upgrade directly from your current version to the latest version. Follow the steps in the [general upgrade guide](general.md), then these additional instructions for the specific versions. (Remember that new config files are not mentioned because they are already covered in the general upgrade guide.)

##Version 4.6.1 to 4.7.1.1
* Delete bin/Iron*.dll (all dll files starting with "Iron")
* Delete bin/RazorEngine*.dll (all dll files starting with "RazorEngine")
* Delete bin/umbraco.MacroEngines.Legacy.dll
* Delete bin/Microsoft.Scripting.Debugging.dll
* Delete bin/Microsoft.Dynamic.dll

##Version 4.7.1.1 to 4.7.2
* Delete the bin/umbraco.MacroEngines.Legacy.dll file

##Version 4.7.2 to 4.8.0
* Delete the bin/App_Browsers.dll file
* Delete the bin/App_global.asax.dll file
* Delete the bin/Fizzler.Systems.HtmlAgilityPack.dll file
* For people using uComponents 3.1.2 or below, 4.8.0 breaks support for it. Either upgrade to a newer version beforehand or follow the workaround [posted here](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/backoffice-extensions/ucomponents/questionssuggestions/33021-Upgrading-to-Umbraco-48-breaks-support-for-uComponents)

##Version 4.8.0 to 4.10.0
* Delete the bin/umbraco.linq.core.dll file
* Copy the new files and folders from the zip file into your site's folder
 * /App_Plugins
 * /Views
 * global.asax
* Remove the Config/formHandlers.config file

##Version 4.10.x to 4.11.x 
* If your site was ever a version between 4.10.0 and 4.11.4 install the [fixup package](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/developer-tools/path-fixup) and run it after the upgrade process is finished.

##Version 4.10.x/4.11.x to 6.0.0 
* If your site was ever a version between 4.10.0 and 4.11.4 and you have just upgraded to 6.0.0 install the [fixup package](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/developer-tools/path-fixup) and run it after the upgrade process is finished.
* The DocType Mixins package is **NOT** compatible with v6+ and will cause problems in your document types.

##Version 6 to 7.0.0
Read and follow [the full v7 upgrade guide](v7-upgrade.md)

##Version 7.0.0 to 7.0.1
* Remove all uGoLive dlls from /bin
 * These are not compatible with V7
* Move appSettings/connectionStrings back to web.config 
 * If you are on 7.0.0 you should migrate these settings into the web.config instead of having them in seperate files in /config/
 * The keys in config/AppSettings.config need to be moved back to the web.config <appSettings> section and similarly, the config/ConnectionStrings.config holds the Umbraco database connections in v7.0.0 and they should be moved back to the web.config <connectionStrings> section. 
 * /config/AppSettings.config and /config/ConnectionString.config can be removed after the contents have been moved back to web.config. (Make backups just in case)
* Delete all files in ~/App_Data/TEMP/Razor/* 
 * Related to issues with razor macros

##Version 7.0.1 to 7.0.2

* There was an update to the /umbraco/config/create/ui.xml which needs to be manually updated, the original element had this text:

		<nodeType alias="users">
			<header>User</header>
			<usercontrol>/create/simple.ascx</usercontrol>
			<tasks>
			  <create assembly="umbraco" type="userTasks" />
			  <delete assembly="umbraco" type="userTasks" />
			</tasks>
		</nodeType>

	* The &lt;usercontrol&gt; value has changed to: **/create/user.ascx**, this is a required change otherwise creating a new user will not work.
* There is a breaking change to be aware of, full details can be found [here](http://umbraco.com/follow-us/blog-archive/2014/1/17/heads-up,-breaking-change-coming-in-702-and-62.aspx).


##Version 7.1.0
* Remove the /Install folder.
