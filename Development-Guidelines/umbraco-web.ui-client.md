## Source folders
Inside the /src folder, the Umbraco 7 source code is devided into 3 groups of code: 

- Less files
- Common / shared JavaScript 
- Views 

### Less files
Everything is loaded into the belle.less which specifies what files to include, the variables.less contains global variabls

### /views
The Views folder contains all the html for the application as well as the Controllers used on those views. The convention for views and controllers are:

- /views/section/Viewname.html
- /views/section/section.viewname.controller.js

So if you are looking for the html and JavaScript used by the content editor look in /src/views/content/edit.html and `/src/vies/content/content.edit.controller.js`

### /common
The Common folder contains all the items that are share between multiple parts of the application, such as Services, Directives and Filters.

So if you want to access the navigationService look in `/src/common/services/navigation.service.js`

For the Umbraco 7 application, we also have introduce the concept of a `Resource`, this term is used for a shared service which primarily is used to access data from the database and perform crud operations on this data. 

Example resources could be:

- /src/common/resources/media.resource.js
- /src/common/resources/entity.resource.js

All resources returns a promise when data is fetched, they use the same pattern for errors and generally require a http backend to work.
On our serverless setup, we use a mocked http backend to simulate data.

### Packages
Folder containing various sample projects on how to use the external api, good for referencing how the package.manifest and property editors work. 

### app.js and app.dev.js
The central application script, which handles what modules to inject, app.js is for production, app.dev.js is for testing

### loader.js
yepnope.js based loader for async loading JavaScript files, this file specifies what files to load on application start

### routes.js
Routing setup for /umbraco/ pages, by default it contains a mvc-like convention based pattern, which means that we not very often need to modify this.
