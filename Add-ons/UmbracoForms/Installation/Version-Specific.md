# Version specific upgrade notes

This page covers specific upgrade documentation for specific versions.

## Version 11

### 11.0

Version 11 of Umbraco Forms has a minimum dependency on Umbraco CMS core of `11.0.0`. It runs on .NET 7.

#### Breaking changes

Version 11 contains a number of breaking changes. We don't expect many projects to be affected by them as they are in areas that are not typical extension points. For reference though, the full details are listed here:

##### Presentation

- A CSS class for each field is rendered out matching the caption of the form field.  This has been changed to use the alias of the form field, as this is considered less likely to change and potentially break custom styles.

##### Code

- The int `DeleteFormRecords(Form form, FormState formState, DateTime deleteRecordsCreatedEarlierThan)` method was added to `IRecordStorage`.
- Name of `FormsUmbracoBuiderExtensions` was corrected to `FormsUmbracoBuilderExtensions`.
- The method `RegenerateFormStructureIds` on Form was amended to return a response.
- The method void `ExecuteWorkflows(List<IWorkflow> workflows, Record record, Form form, FormState state)` was added to `IWorkflowExecutionService`.
- Obsolete constructor on `PlaceholderParsingService` removed.
- Obsolete constructor on `ServerVariablesParsingHandler` removed.
- `IsMandatory` and `Condition` properties were added to the `IWorkflow` and `IWorkflowEntity` interface.
- `DaysToRetainSubmittedRecordsFor` and `DaysToRetainApprovedRecordsForproperties` were added to the `IFormEntity` interface.
- Obsolete constructor on the export type `ExportToExcel` removed.
- Obsolete constructor on the workflow type `SendRazorEmail` removed.
- Obsolete constructor on the controllers `UmbracoFormsController`, `ExportController`, `FieldController`, `FormController`, `RecordController`, and  `EmailTemplateTreeController` removed.
- Duplicate method `GetAllDocumentTypesWithAlias` in `PickerController` was removed.
- Obsolete overloads to the `Build` method on `FormViewModel` were removed.
- Obsolete constructor on `FormRenderingService` was removed.
- Legacy storage of prevalues with captions using a single string with a separator was updated to store them as an object with a value and caption.
    - A `JsonConverter` was added to `FormsJsonSerializerSettings` that will convert forms saved in older versions with the string storage into the new structure.
    - The public field `Field.PrevalueCaptionSeparator` was removed.
    - `Field.Prevalues` now returns `IEnumerable<FieldPrevalue>` instead of `IEnumerable<string>`, and the property `Field.ParsedPreValues` was removed.
- The obsolete overload of the methods `Test` and `TestRule` in `FieldConditionEvaluation` was removed and the existing method made private.
- The obsolete overload of the method `IsVisible` in `FieldConditionEvaluation` was removed.
- The property `ConditionCheckFunctions` was added to the `IFieldType` interface.
- The property `Alias` was added to the interfaces for all provider types inheriting from `ProviderBase`.

## Version 10

### 10.1

#### Breaking changes

- The default theme has been updated to render captions for field types that support prevalues. If you have created any custom themes, please review the default theme and ensure you make similar changes to make use of the new feature.
- The method `PreValues` on the `FieldViewModel` type has been changed from a collection of strings to a collection of a `PrevalueViewModel` object that has a Value and Caption property.
- In order to fix an issue with display and editing of values, we've found a need to ensure the property representing the fields a record entry used in the backoffice is changed from a list of values to a structure containing the field Ids and values. Specifically, `EntrySearchResult.Fields` has changed type `IEnumerable<object?>` to `IEnumerable<EntrySearchResult.FieldData>`.  The only scenarios affected by this would be anyone handling the `EntrySearchResultFetchingNotification` notification or developing custom export types.

### 10.0

Version 10 of Umbraco Forms has a minimum dependency on Umbraco CMS core of `10.0.0`. It runs on .NET 6.

To migrate to version 10, you should first update to the latest minor release of version 9. If you are upgrading from Umbraco 8, update Forms to the latest minor version of Forms 8 and ensure you have the configuration in place for storing form definitions in the database. For more information, see the [Umbraco Forms in the Database](../Developer/Forms-in-the-Database/index-v8.md) article.

Either way will ensure you have all the database schema changes in place.

#### Views and client-side files

Umbraco 10 distributes the views and client-side files as part of a Razor class library, distributed in the Umbraco.Forms.StaticAssets package.  This means these assets are no longer individual files available on disk. The advantage of this approach is that that avoids changes made to them by solution developers being inadvertently lost when the project is rebuilt.

When upgrading from Forms 9, you should either first run a `dotnet clean`, or, after installing Forms 10, delete the `App_Plugins/UmbracoForms` folder.  This will ensure there aren't two copies of the `package.manifest` file, which would cause issues by registering duplicate property editors.

For views, assuming you are using the default theme and templates, you should also remove the following folders and files (again, either via a `dotnet clean` before upgrading, or manually afterward):

- `/Views/MacroPartials/InsertUmbracoFormWithTheme.cshtml`
- `/Views/MacroPartials/RenderUmbracoFormScripts.cshtml`
- `/Views/Partials/Forms/`

If you have custom themes or other changes to the files in the `Views/Partials/Forms` folder, you should ensure those files remain.

For example, with a custom email template, remove the file `Example-Template.cshtml` from the `/Views/Forms/Emails` folder but keep any custom templates.

Similarly, if you have a custom theme, remove the `default` and `bootstrap3-horizontal` folders from the `/Views/Partials/Forms/Themes/` folder but keep any custom theme folders.

#### Breaking changes

Version 10 contains a number of breaking changes but we won't expect many projects to be affected by them as they are in areas that are not typical extension points. For reference though, the full details are listed here.

##### Configuration

- Renamed the configuration option to allow editable form submissions on the front-end to `AllowEditableFormSubmissions` (fixing the typo in the previous value of `AllowEditableFormSubmissions`).

- The `EventExtensions` class is no longer used since V9 and has been removed.
- Static events from `BaseFileStorage` removed and replaced with notifications.

  - `FormEventArgs`
  - `FolderEventArgs`
  - `FieldPreValueSourceEventArgs`

- The obsoleted method `RegenerateFieldSetAndFieldIds` on `Form` has been removed,
- The constructor of `FolderNotificationHandler` had an unused parameter removed.
- The obsolete and unused methods `CanCurrentUserEdit`, `CanCurrentUserAddInEditor`, `CanCurrentUserManageWorkflows`, `EnsureUserExist`s and `CanCurrentUserExport` were removed from the `IFormSecurity` interface.
- The type parameter `TEventArgs` defined on `IBaseService` (and derived interfaces) has been removed.

## Version 9

Version 9 of Umbraco Forms has a minimum dependency on Umbraco CMS core of `9.0.1` and runs on .NET 5.

### 9.5

See notes under 10.1.

## Version 8

Version 8 of Umbraco Forms has a minimum dependency on Umbraco CMS core of `8.0.0` and runs on .NET Framework 7.2.

In order to upgrade from Umbraco Forms 7 to Umbraco Forms 8 make sure you read the [Manual Upgrade instructions](ManualUpgrade).

### 8.13

See notes under 10.1.

## Version 4 to Version 6

Upgrading to Version 6 of Umbraco Forms, has a higher minimum dependency on Umbraco CMS core of `7.6.0` & higher. The reasoning behind this is due to some underlying changes to ensure Forms works with Umbraco Cloud & Deploy.

With Umbraco you have many options to upgrade Umbraco Forms.

* You can install the Forms package via the community package search from within the Developer Tab in the CMS
* Umbraco Forms can be downloaded directly from [our.umbraco.com](https://our.umbraco.com/packages/developer-tools/umbraco-forms/)
* You can download a ZIP file containing the updated files which you can unzip & apply over the top of your existing install
* You can upgrade Forms using NuGet. Doing this will require a few more steps, which you can find in the next section

### Upgrading with NuGet

Using NuGet to perform an Upgrade of Umbraco Forms to the next major version, you will run into a problem where the legacy MacroPartial view file will be removed from the site. This causes any existing Umbraco Forms rendered on the site to stop functioning.
Before running the site after the NuGet upgrade again; consider this may need to be done on each environment depending on your deployment process/setup. You will need to copy/restore the following file `Views/MacroPartials/InsertUmbracoForm.cshtml` from your source control solution.

The file needs to be here before the site is restarted - due to the migration/upgrade tasks listed below.

For new & clean installs done with NuGet this will not be a problem for you, as only the new Macro & its associated MacroPartial view file is part of the new NuGet version.


### Upgrade tasks
The following outlines for `version 6.0.0` what upgrade/migration tasks that are being performed:

* Rename legacy macro to make it easier to identify in the backoffice
* Adds new form macro to insert a form with a theme
* Moves JSON Form Storage files from `App_Plugins/UmbracoForms/Data` to `App_Data/UmbracoForms/Data` by default unless a custom Forms IFileSystem is configured such as Azure blob storage
* Moves any Form PreValue sources that uses text files that were uploaded to the media section & now stores in the Umbraco Forms IFileSystem

### Recommendation
We highly recommend you make the switch away from the legacy macro and swap over to the newer macro that supports the new 6.0.0 feature of themes. The legacy macro is there to ease the transition over and to avoid entire sites forms to stop working.
