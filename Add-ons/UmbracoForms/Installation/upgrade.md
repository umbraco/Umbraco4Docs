#Keeping Umbraco Forms up to date
Forms makes it easy to stay in sync with the latest releases, so you can take advantage of new features and bug fixes.

##Checking for updates
You won't have to check for updates manually. Umbraco Forms will inform you when a new update is available, just navigate to the forms dashboard and if you see the following then a new version is already available.
