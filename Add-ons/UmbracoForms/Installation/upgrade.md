# Keeping Umbraco Forms up to date
Forms allows you to stay in sync with the latest releases, so you can take advantage of new features and bug fixes.

## Checking for updates
You won't have to check for updates manually. Umbraco Forms will inform you when a new update is available. Navigate to the Forms dashboard and if you see the following then a new version is already available.

Once it's completed the upgrade notification should be gone and you can continue using a newly updated Umbraco Forms.
