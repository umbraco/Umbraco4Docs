# Overview of the default workflow types

There are a couple of default workflow types that can be used to extend the functionality of your form. Here is an overview:

## Change Record State

This workflow is used to automatically **approve** or **delete** a record once it is submitted.

Configure some words that you want to check for, and select whether these words should trigger a deletion or an approval.

Besides a name, the following configuration can be set:

* URL (required)
* Method
* XsltFile - used to transform the XML
* Headers - map the needed files
* User and password

## Save as an XML file

![Save as XML](images/save-as-an-xml-file.png)

This workflow will save the result of the form as an XML file by using XSLT.
In the configuration you can configure the following settings:

* Path - where to save the XML file (required)

## Save as Umbraco Content Node

![Save as content node](images/save-as-content-node.png)

This workflow gives you the option to save a forms submission as a new content node.

First of all, you need to choose a Document type and match the fields in the form with the properties on the selected Document Type. You can also choose to set a static value to fill in the properties.

![Save as content node](images/create-new-node.png)

In the example above, a Document Type called 'Blogpost' is selected to be used for creating the new content node. Furthermore, the value from the 'Name' field will be added as the 'Node Name' property in the new content node, and the value from the 'Email' field will be used for the 'Content' property.

Other configuration:

* Publish - choose whether to publish the node on submission
* Where to save - choose a section in the content tree where this new node should be added
