# Attaching workflows
Submitting a form will result in the record data being stored in the database, if you wish to attach extra functionality to your form you can do so by assigning 1 or multiple workflows (like sending an email).

## Adding a workflow

### Navigate to the workflow section at the bottom of your form
Select the *configure workflow* option in the bottom right corner.
