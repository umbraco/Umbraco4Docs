# Localization

From versions 8.10 and 9.2, the various labels, descriptions and buttons that make up the backoffice screens for Umbraco Forms can be translated into different languages.

When an editor chooses a language for their account, Umbraco CMS will render appropriate translations. The translations will contain a file for that language and a key for the label in question.  If either of these can't be found, the label will be displayed in English (US).

## Language Files

Umbraco Forms ships with translations for various languages, which can be found in the `App_Plugins/UmbracoForms/app/lang/` folder.  If the language you require does not exist, it's possible to create your own by duplicating the default `en-us.xml` file, saving it with the appropriate [culture code](https://app.slack.com/client/T025KPYEV/G8LFSGMFB) and replacing the English text with the translated version.
