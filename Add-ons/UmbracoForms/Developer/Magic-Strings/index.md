# Magic strings
Umbraco Forms has some magic strings that enable you to render values from various sources, such as Session, Cookies, Umbraco Page fields. 

## Where can I use these magic strings?
These magic strings as we call them can be used in form fields (as a label, description or default value) and in workflows. They can be used in default values in hidden fields for examples, normally referral codes from a session, cookie or request item.

These values can be usedalso in Workflows property/settings. So a name and email address field from the form can be used in an email workflow to send the customer a personalised thank you email.

## Request

`[@SomeRequestItem]` this allows you to display an item from the current HTTPContext.Request with the key of SomeRequestItem.
Some examples of variables that are normally available in HttpContext.Request:

`[@Url]`: Insert the current url  
`[@Http_referer]`: The previous visited url (if available)  
`[@Remote_addr]`: The IP address of the visitor (stored by default by Umbraco)  
`[@Http_User_Agent]`: The browser of the visitor  
  
The variables are not case-sensitive.  

## Session & Cookies
`[%SomeSessionOrCookieItem]` this allows you to display an item from the current HTTPContext.Session with the key of SomeSessionOrCookieItem. The session key can only contain alphanumeric chars and you cannot use dots for example. `[%Member.Firstname]` cannot be used, but `[MemberFirstname]` can be used. You would have to fill these session keys yourself.

If it cannot be found in the collection of session keys, it will then try to find the item from the HttpContext.Cookies collection with the same key.

## Umbraco Page Field Item
`[#myUmbracoField]` this allows you to insert a property of that page and is based on the alias of the field. If your page has a property with the alias 'title', you can use `[#title]` in your form.

Some extra variables are:  
`[#pageName]`: The nodename of the current page  
`[#pageID]`: The node ID of the current page  

## Recursive Umbraco Page Field Item
`[$myRecursiveItem]` this allows you to parse the Umbraco document-type property myRecursiveItem. So if the current page does not contain a value for this then it will request it from the parent up until the root or until it finds a value.

## Parsing Umbraco Form field items
`{myAliasForFormField}` this allows you to display the entered value for that specific field from the form submission. Used in workflows to send an automated email back to the customer based on the email address submitted in the form. The value here needs to be the alias of the field, and not the name of the field.  

## Parsing Member properties from a form submission
`{member.FOO}` with the prefix of member. in the same syntax above will allow you to retrieve information about the submission if it was submitted by a logged in member.

## How can I parse these values elsewhere in my C# code or Razor Views?
The `Umbraco.Forms.Data.StringHelpers` class contains helper methods for parsing magic strings:

    // Does not parse Record-related magic strings - they are simply removed.
    public static string ParsePlaceHolders(HttpContext context, string value) 
    
    // Uses the passed in Record to parse Record-related magic strings
    public static string ParsePlaceHolders(Record record, string value)
    
    public static string ParsePlaceHolders(HttpContext context, Record record, string value)

There is also a public extension method `ParsePlaceHolders()`extending the `string` object in the `Umbraco.Forms.Core.Extensions` namespace that can be used with anything that you wish to try and replace the above tokens in a string, but it doesn't currently work with Records.
