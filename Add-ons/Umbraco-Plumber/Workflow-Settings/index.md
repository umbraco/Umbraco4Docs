# Workflow Settings

When working with Umbraco Plumber, you can handle the workflow settings directly in the Backoffice from the **Workflow** section. You can configure general workflow settings, new node approval flows, Document type approval flows, and exclude nodes.

## General Settings

You can configure the **General** Settings from the **Workflow** section in the **Settings** menu. The following settings are available:

![General settings](images/general-settings.png)

- **Flow type** - Determines the approval flow progress. These options manage how the Change Author is included in the workflow:
  - **Explicit** - All steps of the workflow must be completed and all users will be notified of tasks (including the Change Author).
  - **Implicit** - All steps where the original Change Author is NOT a member of the group must be completed. Steps where the original Change Author is a member of the approving group will be completed automatically and noted in the workflow history as not required.
  - **Exclude** - Similar to Explicit. All steps must be completed but the original Change Author is not included in the notifications or shown in the dashboard tasks.
- **Lock active content** - Determines how the content in a workflow should be managed. Set to `true` or `false` depending on whether the approval group responsible for the active workflow step should make modifications to the content.
- **Allow attachments** - Provide an attachment (such as a supporting document or enable referencing a media item) when initiating a workflow. This feature is useful when a workflow requires supporting documentation.
- **Use workflow for unpublish** - Determines if unpublish actions require workflow approval.
- **Extend permissions** - Determines if Umbraco Plumber should extend or replace the users' save and publish permissions. The default behavior is to replace the users' permissions.
