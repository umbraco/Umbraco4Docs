# Licensing

Umbraco Plumber is a licensed product but does not require a purchase to use. New installs are defaulted to a trial license, while the paid license is available for purchase. The trial license introduces some restrictions around advanced features but is otherwise a full-featured workflow platform. The paid license is valid for one top-level domain and all its subdomains.

To impersonate the full license on a local site:

1. Create an empty text file named `test.lic`.
2. Copy the `test.lic` file  into `/App_plugins/Plumber`.

:::note
The test license is restricted to sites running in a development environment, with a debugger attached (ie hitting F5 in Visual Studio, in Debug mode, will enable the test license).
