# Workflow History

The Workflow History provides a chronological audit trail of workflow activity for all the nodes.

It displays a table containing the following details:

- Page name/Node with the Language variant.
- Type of Publish.
- Who the workflow was requested by.
- The date the workflow was requested.
- The comment describing the changes.
- Status of the workflow.

You can also **Filter** the records based on the Node, Requested by, Created date, Completed date, Page Language, Workflow Type, and Workflow Status.

The **Detail** button at the end of the record displays an overlay with content similar to the Active workflow sub-section.
