# Notifications and Reminders

Umbraco Plumber uses Notifications to allow you to configure email notifications for all workflow activities for the backoffice.

From the **Settings** view in the **Workflow** section, the **Notifications** tab provides access to the following:

- **Send notifications:** If you wish to send email notifications to approval groups, you can enable it here. If your users are active in the backoffice, email notifications might not be required.
- **Workflow email:** Provide a sender address for email notifications. This is a mandatory field.
- **Reminder delay (days):** Set a delay in days for sending reminder emails for outstanding workflow processes. Set to 0 to disable reminder emails.
- **Edit site URL:** The URL for the editing environment (including schema - http[s]). This is a mandatory field.
- **Site URL:** The URL for the public website (including schema - http[s]). This is a mandatory field.
- **Email templates:** Configure which users receive emails for which workflow actions and modify the templates for those emails.

## Notifications

Notification emails use HTML templates which render information from the `HtmlEmailModel` type which lives in the `Plumber.Core.Models.Email` namespace. While it is possible to modify the email templates from the backoffice, it is recommended to make changes via an IDE of your choice.

The `HtmlEmailModel` contains the following fields:

| Fields        | Data Type                 | Description                                                                                                      |

| ScheduledDate | DateTime                  | If a scheduled date exists for the workflow, it is found here.                                                   |
| Summary       | IHtmlString               | A pre-generated representation of the current workflow state.                                                    |
| CurrentTask   | WorkflowTaskViewModel     | The view model data for the current workflow task. Contains a lot of useful data, best explored via Intellisense.|

The `HtmlEmailBase` contains the following fields:

| Fields       | Data Type      | Description                                                                                         |

| EmailType    | EmailType      | An `enum` value representing the current email type that relates directly to the workflow task type.  |
| To           | EmailUserModel | The model defining the receiver of the email.                                                       |

| IsGroupEmail | bool           | Is the email being sent to a generic group email address?                                           |

Umbraco Plumber provides **Settings** for determining who receives emails at which stages of a workflow. While these are set to default values during installation, it is recommended to update your Notifications Settings to better suit your installation needs. Emails can be sent to:

- **All**: All the participants in all workflow stages (previous and current).
- **Admin**: The admin user.
- **Author**: The user who initiated the workflow.
- **Group**: All members of the group assigned to the current task.

:::note
Duplicate users are removed from email notifications.
:::

By default, all emails are sent to the **Group**. This might not always be an ideal situation. For example: cancelled workflows would be best sent to the **Author** only, likewise with rejected.

It might be useful to notify **All** the participants of completed workflows but even this may be excessive. Depending on your website, you can adjust the best configuration.

## Reminders

Umbraco Plumber uses a reminder email system to prompt editors to complete the pending workflows. Reminders are sent using Umbraco's internal task scheduler, every 24 hours after an initial delay. For example, setting the **Reminder delay (days)** value to 2 in the Workflow **Settings** section will allow pending workflows to sit for 2 days. After that reminder emails will be sent every 24 hours to all members of the group assigned to the pending workflow task.

The emails use a similar model to the notification emails, also inheriting from `HtmlEmailBase`. In addition to the inherited fields, `HtmlReminderEmailModel` includes:

| Fields       | Data Type                     | Description                                                           |
|--------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OverdueTasks | IList<WorkflowTaskViewModel>  | A list containing all the overdue tasks assigned to the current user. |
| TaskCount    | int                           | The count of overdue tasks assigned to the current user.              |
