# Umbraco Plumber

In this article, you can read about [Umbraco Plumber](https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/plumber-workflow-for-umbraco/) and how to get started.

## Umbraco Plumber Overview

Umbraco Plumber allows the creation of multi-stage approval workflows when writing and publishing content. Umbraco Plumber extends Umbraco's out-of-the-box publishing model with multi-stage and configurable approval workflows. A workflow process comprises of multiple steps and multiple users assigned to the group responsible for providing approval at each step.

A user can be a member of multiple groups in the same workflow. To initiate an approval workflow, a user updates the content, saves their changes, then selects **Request publish**.

The workflow Dashboard updates to reflect the state of each task, providing an overview of a user's submissions and tasks. Tasks can be approved, cancelled, or rejected from the **Dashboard** or from the content node **Workflow** tab. For more information, see the [Dashboards and Buttons](../Dashboards-and-Buttons/index.md) article.
